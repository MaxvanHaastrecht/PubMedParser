TI  - Natural language processing of symptoms documented in free-text narratives of 
      electronic health records: a systematic review.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Natural language processing (NLP) of symptoms from electronic health 
      records (EHRs) could contribute to the advancement of symptom science. We aim to 
      synthesize the literature on the use of NLP to process or analyze symptom 
      information documented in EHR free-text narratives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our 
      search of 1964 records from PubMed and EMBASE was narrowed to 27 eligible articles. 
      Data related to the purpose, free-text corpus, patients, symptoms, NLP methodology, 
      evaluation metrics, and quality indicators were extracted for each study. RESULTS: 
      Symptom-related information was presented as a primary outcome in 14 studies. EHR 
      narratives represented various inpatient and outpatient clinical specialties, with 
      general, cardiology, and mental health occurring most frequently. Studies 
      encompassed a wide variety of symptoms, including shortness of breath, pain, nausea, 
      dizziness, disturbed sleep, constipation, and depressed mood. NLP approaches 
      included previously developed NLP tools, classification methods, and manually 
      curated rule-based processing. Only one-third (n = 9) of studies reported patient 
      demographic characteristics. DISCUSSION: NLP is used to extract information from EHR 
      free-text narratives written by a variety of healthcare providers on an expansive 
      range of symptoms across diverse clinical specialties. The current focus of this 
      field is on the development of methods to extract symptom information and the use of 
      symptom information for disease classification tasks rather than the examination of 
      symptoms themselves. CONCLUSION: Future NLP studies should concentrate on the 
      investigation of symptoms and symptom documentation in EHR free-text narratives. 
      Efforts should be undertaken to examine patient characteristics and make 
      symptom-related NLP algorithms or pipelines and vocabularies openly available.

TI  - Natural Language Processing of Clinical Notes on Chronic Diseases: Systematic 
      Review.
PG  - e12239
LID - 10.2196/12239 [doi]
LID - e12239
AB  - BACKGROUND: Novel approaches that complement and go beyond evidence-based medicine 
      are required in the domain of chronic diseases, given the growing incidence of such 
      conditions on the worldwide population. A promising avenue is the secondary use of 
      electronic health records (EHRs), where patient data are analyzed to conduct 
      clinical and translational research. Methods based on machine learning to process 
      EHRs are resulting in improved understanding of patient clinical trajectories and 
      chronic disease risk prediction, creating a unique opportunity to derive previously 
      unknown clinical insights. However, a wealth of clinical histories remains locked 
      behind clinical narratives in free-form text. Consequently, unlocking the full 
      potential of EHR data is contingent on the development of natural language 
      processing (NLP) methods to automatically transform clinical text into structured 
      clinical data that can guide clinical decisions and potentially delay or prevent 
      disease onset. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to provide a comprehensive 
      overview of the development and uptake of NLP methods applied to free-text clinical 
      notes related to chronic diseases, including the investigation of challenges faced 
      by NLP methodologies in understanding clinical narratives. METHODS: Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were 
      followed and searches were conducted in 5 databases using "clinical notes," "natural 
      language processing," and "chronic disease" and their variations as keywords to 
      maximize coverage of the articles. RESULTS: Of the 2652 articles considered, 106 met 
      the inclusion criteria. Review of the included papers resulted in identification of 
      43 chronic diseases, which were then further classified into 10 disease categories 
      using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. The majority of 
      studies focused on diseases of the circulatory system (n=38) while endocrine and 
      metabolic diseases were fewest (n=14). This was due to the structure of clinical 
      records related to metabolic diseases, which typically contain much more structured 
      data, compared with medical records for diseases of the circulatory system, which 
      focus more on unstructured data and consequently have seen a stronger focus of NLP. 
      The review has shown that there is a significant increase in the use of machine 
      learning methods compared to rule-based approaches; however, deep learning methods 
      remain emergent (n=3). Consequently, the majority of works focus on classification 
      of disease phenotype with only a handful of papers addressing extraction of 
      comorbidities from the free text or integration of clinical notes with structured 
      data. There is a notable use of relatively simple methods, such as shallow 
      classifiers (or combination with rule-based methods), due to the interpretability of 
      predictions, which still represents a significant issue for more complex methods. 
      Finally, scarcity of publicly available data may also have contributed to 
      insufficient development of more advanced methods, such as extraction of word 
      embeddings from clinical notes. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts are still required to improve 
      (1) progression of clinical NLP methods from extraction toward understanding; (2) 
      recognition of relations among entities rather than entities in isolation; (3) 
      temporal extraction to understand past, current, and future clinical events; (4) 
      exploitation of alternative sources of clinical knowledge; and (5) availability of 
      large-scale, de-identified clinical corpora.

      Patients With COVID-19: Retrospective Study Using Machine Learning and Natural 
      Language Processing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many factors involved in the onset and clinical course of the ongoing 
      COVID-19 pandemic are still unknown. Although big data analytics and artificial 
      intelligence are widely used in the realms of health and medicine, researchers are 
      only beginning to use these tools to explore the clinical characteristics and 
      predictive factors of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Our primary objectives are 
      to describe the clinical characteristics and determine the factors that predict 
      intensive care unit (ICU) admission of patients with COVID-19. Determining these 
      factors using a well-defined population can increase our understanding of the 
      real-world epidemiology of the disease. METHODS: We used a combination of classic 
      epidemiological methods, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning 
      (for predictive modeling) to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of 
      patients with COVID-19. We explored the unstructured free text in the EHRs within 
      the Servicio de Salud de Castilla-La Mancha (SESCAM) Health Care Network 
      (Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) from the entire population with available EHRs 
      (1,364,924 patients) from January 1 to March 29, 2020. We extracted related clinical 
      information regarding diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. 
      RESULTS: A total of 10,504 patients with a clinical or polymerase chain 
      reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified; 5519 (52.5%) were male, 
      with a mean age of 58.2 years (SD 19.7). Upon admission, the most common symptoms 
      were cough, fever, and dyspnea; however, all three symptoms occurred in fewer than 
      half of the cases. Overall, 6.1% (83/1353) of hospitalized patients required ICU 
      admission. Using a machine-learning, data-driven algorithm, we identified that a 
      combination of age, fever, and tachypnea was the most parsimonious predictor of ICU 
      admission; patients younger than 56 years, without tachypnea, and temperature <39 
      degrees Celsius (or >39 ºC without respiratory crackles) were not admitted to the 
      ICU. In contrast, patients with COVID-19 aged 40 to 79 years were likely to be 
      admitted to the ICU if they had tachypnea and delayed their visit to the emergency 
      department after being seen in primary care. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a 
      combination of easily obtainable clinical variables (age, fever, and tachypnea with 
      or without respiratory crackles) predicts whether patients with COVID-19 will 
      require ICU admission.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical narratives represent the main form of communication within 
      health care, providing a personalized account of patient history and assessments, 
      and offering rich information for clinical decision making. Natural language 
      processing (NLP) has repeatedly demonstrated its feasibility to unlock evidence 
      buried in clinical narratives. Machine learning can facilitate rapid development of 
      NLP tools by leveraging large amounts of text data. OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this 
      study was to provide systematic evidence on the properties of text data used to 
      train machine learning approaches to clinical NLP. We also investigated the types of 
      NLP tasks that have been supported by machine learning and how they can be applied 
      in clinical practice. METHODS: Our methodology was based on the guidelines for 
      performing systematic reviews. In August 2018, we used PubMed, a multifaceted 
      interface, to perform a literature search against MEDLINE. We identified 110 
      relevant studies and extracted information about text data used to support machine 
      learning, NLP tasks supported, and their clinical applications. The data properties 
      considered included their size, provenance, collection methods, annotation, and any 
      relevant statistics. RESULTS: The majority of datasets used to train machine 
      learning models included only hundreds or thousands of documents. Only 10 studies 
      used tens of thousands of documents, with a handful of studies utilizing more. 
      Relatively small datasets were utilized for training even when much larger datasets 
      were available. The main reason for such poor data utilization is the annotation 
      bottleneck faced by supervised machine learning algorithms. Active learning was 
      explored to iteratively sample a subset of data for manual annotation as a strategy 
      for minimizing the annotation effort while maximizing the predictive performance of 
      the model. Supervised learning was successfully used where clinical codes integrated 
      with free-text notes into electronic health records were utilized as class labels. 
      Similarly, distant supervision was used to utilize an existing knowledge base to 
      automatically annotate raw text. Where manual annotation was unavoidable, 
      crowdsourcing was explored, but it remains unsuitable because of the sensitive 
      nature of data considered. Besides the small volume, training data were typically 
      sourced from a small number of institutions, thus offering no hard evidence about 
      the transferability of machine learning models. The majority of studies focused on 
      text classification. Most commonly, the classification results were used to support 
      phenotyping, prognosis, care improvement, resource management, and surveillance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We identified the data annotation bottleneck as one of the key 
      obstacles to machine learning approaches in clinical NLP. Active learning and 
      distant supervision were explored as a way of saving the annotation efforts. Future 
      research in this field would benefit from alternatives such as data augmentation and 
      transfer learning, or unsupervised learning, which do not require data annotation.

AB  - With the emergence of electronic health records, the reuse of clinical data offers 
      new perspectives for the diagnosis and management of patients with rare diseases. 
      However, there are many obstacles to the repurposing of clinical data. The 
      development of decision support systems depends on the ability to recruit patients, 
      extract and integrate the patients' data, mine and stratify these data, and 
      integrate the decision support algorithm into patient care. This last step requires 
      an adaptability of the electronic health records to integrate learning health system 
      tools. In this literature review, we examine the research that provides solutions to 
      unlock these barriers and accelerate translational research: structured electronic 
      health records and free-text search engines to find patients, data warehouses and 
      natural language processing to extract phenotypes, machine learning algorithms to 
      classify patients, and similarity metrics to diagnose patients. Medical informatics 
      is experiencing an impellent request to develop decision support systems, and this 
      requires ethical considerations for clinicians and patients to ensure appropriate 
      use of health data.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs), originally designed to facilitate health care 
      delivery, are becoming a valuable data source for health research. EHR systems have 
      two components, both of which have various components, and points of data entry, 
      management, and analysis. The "front end" refers to where the data are entered, 
      primarily by healthcare workers (e.g. physicians and nurses). The second component 
      of EHR systems is the electronic data warehouse, or "back-end," where the data are 
      stored in a relational database. EHR data elements can be of many types, which can 
      be categorized as structured, unstructured free-text, and imaging data. The Sunrise 
      Clinical Manager (SCM) EHR is one example of an inpatient EHR system, which covers 
      the city of Calgary (Alberta, Canada). This system, under the management of Alberta 
      Health Services, is now being explored for research use. The purpose of the present 
      paper is to describe the SCM EHR for research purposes, showing how this generalizes 
      to EHRs in general. We further discuss advantages, challenges (e.g. potential bias 
      and data quality issues), analytical capacities, and requirements associated with 
      using EHRs in a health research context.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, more electronic data sources are becoming available in the 
      healthcare domain. Electronic health records (EHRs), with their vast amounts of 
      potentially available data, can greatly improve healthcare. Although EHR 
      de-identification is necessary to protect personal information, automatic 
      de-identification of Japanese language EHRs has not been studied sufficiently. This 
      study was conducted to raise de-identification performance for Japanese EHRs through 
      classic machine learning, deep learning, and rule-based methods, depending on the 
      dataset. RESULTS: Using three datasets, we implemented de-identification systems for 
      Japanese EHRs and compared the de-identification performances found for rule-based, 
      Conditional Random Fields (CRF), and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based methods. 
      Gold standard tags for de-identification are annotated manually for age, hospital, 
      person, sex, and time. We used different combinations of our datasets to train and 
      evaluate our three methods. Our best F1-scores were 84.23, 68.19, and 81.67 points, 
      respectively, for evaluations of the MedNLP dataset, a dummy EHR dataset that was 
      virtually written by a medical doctor, and a Pathology Report dataset. Our 
      LSTM-based method was the best performing, except for the MedNLP dataset. The 
      rule-based method was best for the MedNLP dataset. The LSTM-based method achieved a 
      good score of 83.07 points for this MedNLP dataset, which differs by 1.16 points 
      from the best score obtained using the rule-based method. Results suggest that LSTM 
      adapted well to different characteristics of our datasets. Our LSTM-based method 
      performed better than our CRF-based method, yielding a 7.41 point F1-score, when 
      applied to our Pathology Report dataset. This report is the first of study applying 
      this LSTM-based method to any de-identification task of a Japanese EHR. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our LSTM-based machine learning method was able to extract named entities to be 
      de-identified with better performance, in general, than that of our rule-based 
      methods. However, machine learning methods are inadequate for processing expressions 
      with low occurrence. Our future work will specifically examine the combination of 
      LSTM and rule-based methods to achieve better performance. Our currently achieved 
      level of performance is sufficiently higher than that of publicly available Japanese 
      de-identification tools. Therefore, our system will be applied to actual 
      de-identification tasks in hospitals.

TI  - Incorporating natural language processing to improve classification of axial 
      spondyloarthritis using electronic health records.
PG  - 1059-1065
LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/kez375 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop classification algorithms that accurately identify axial SpA 
      (axSpA) patients in electronic health records, and compare the performance of 
      algorithms incorporating free-text data against approaches using only International 
      Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. METHODS: An enriched cohort of 7853 eligible 
      patients was created from electronic health records of two large hospitals using 
      automated searches (⩾1 ICD codes combined with simple text searches). Key disease 
      concepts from free-text data were extracted using NLP and combined with ICD codes to 
      develop algorithms. We created both supervised regression-based algorithms-on a 
      training set of 127 axSpA cases and 423 non-cases-and unsupervised algorithms to 
      identify patients with high probability of having axSpA from the enriched cohort. 
      Their performance was compared against classifications using ICD codes only. 
      RESULTS: NLP extracted four disease concepts of high predictive value: ankylosing 
      spondylitis, sacroiliitis, HLA-B27 and spondylitis. The unsupervised algorithm, 
      incorporating both the NLP concept and ICD code for AS, identified the greatest 
      number of patients. By setting the probability threshold to attain 80% positive 
      predictive value, it identified 1509 axSpA patients (mean age 53 years, 71% male). 
      Sensitivity was 0.78, specificity 0.94 and area under the curve 0.93. The two 
      supervised algorithms performed similarly but identified fewer patients. All three 
      outperformed traditional approaches using ICD codes alone (area under the curve 
      0.80-0.87). CONCLUSION: Algorithms incorporating free-text data can accurately 
      identify axSpA patients in electronic health records. Large cohorts identified using 
      these novel methods offer exciting opportunities for future clinical research.

TI  - Efficient Reuse of Natural Language Processing Models for Phenotype-Mention 
      Identification in Free-text Electronic Medical Records: A Phenotype Embedding 
      Approach.
PG  - e14782
LID - 10.2196/14782 [doi]
LID - e14782
AB  - BACKGROUND: Much effort has been put into the use of automated approaches, such as 
      natural language processing (NLP), to mine or extract data from free-text medical 
      records in order to construct comprehensive patient profiles for delivering better 
      health care. Reusing NLP models in new settings, however, remains cumbersome, as it 
      requires validation and retraining on new data iteratively to achieve convergent 
      results. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to minimize the effort involved in 
      reusing NLP models on free-text medical records. METHODS: We formally define and 
      analyze the model adaptation problem in phenotype-mention identification tasks. We 
      identify "duplicate waste" and "imbalance waste," which collectively impede 
      efficient model reuse. We propose a phenotype embedding-based approach to minimize 
      these sources of waste without the need for labelled data from new settings. 
      RESULTS: We conduct experiments on data from a large mental health registry to reuse 
      NLP models in four phenotype-mention identification tasks. The proposed approach can 
      choose the best model for a new task, identifying up to 76% waste (duplicate waste), 
      that is, phenotype mentions without the need for validation and model retraining and 
      with very good performance (93%-97% accuracy). It can also provide guidance for 
      validating and retraining the selected model for novel language patterns in new 
      tasks, saving around 80% waste (imbalance waste), that is, the effort required in 
      "blind" model-adaptation approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Adapting pretrained NLP models for 
      new tasks can be more efficient and effective if the language pattern landscapes of 
      old settings and new settings can be made explicit and comparable. Our experiments 
      show that the phenotype-mention embedding approach is an effective way to model 
      language patterns for phenotype-mention identification tasks and that its use can 
      guide efficient NLP model reuse.

TI  - Effect of Behavioral Interventions on Inappropriate Antibiotic Prescribing Among 
      Primary Care Practices: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 562-70
LID - 10.1001/jama.2016.0275 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Interventions based on behavioral science might reduce inappropriate 
      antibiotic prescribing. OBJECTIVE: To assess effects of behavioral interventions and 
      rates of inappropriate (not guideline-concordant) antibiotic prescribing during 
      ambulatory visits for acute respiratory tract infections. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized clinical trial conducted among 47 primary care 
      practices in Boston and Los Angeles. Participants were 248 enrolled clinicians 
      randomized to receive 0, 1, 2, or 3 interventions for 18 months. All clinicians 
      received education on antibiotic prescribing guidelines on enrollment. Interventions 
      began between November 1, 2011, and October 1, 2012. Follow-up for the 
      latest-starting sites ended on April 1, 2014. Adult patients with comorbidities and 
      concomitant infections were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Three behavioral interventions, 
      implemented alone or in combination: suggested alternatives presented electronic 
      order sets suggesting nonantibiotic treatments; accountable justification prompted 
      clinicians to enter free-text justifications for prescribing antibiotics into 
      patients' electronic health records; peer comparison sent emails to clinicians that 
      compared their antibiotic prescribing rates with those of "top performers" (those 
      with the lowest inappropriate prescribing rates). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Antibiotic prescribing rates for visits with antibiotic-inappropriate diagnoses 
      (nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, acute bronchitis, and influenza) 
      from 18 months preintervention to 18 months afterward, adjusting each intervention's 
      effects for co-occurring interventions and preintervention trends, with random 
      effects for practices and clinicians. RESULTS: There were 14,753 visits (mean 
      patient age, 47 years; 69% women) for antibiotic-inappropriate acute respiratory 
      tract infections during the baseline period and 16,959 visits (mean patient age, 48 
      years; 67% women) during the intervention period. Mean antibiotic prescribing rates 
      decreased from 24.1% at intervention start to 13.1% at intervention month 18 
      (absolute difference, -11.0%) for control practices; from 22.1% to 6.1% (absolute 
      difference, -16.0%) for suggested alternatives (difference in differences, -5.0% 
      [95% CI, -7.8% to 0.1%]; P = .66 for differences in trajectories); from 23.2% to 
      5.2% (absolute difference, -18.1%) for accountable justification (difference in 
      differences, -7.0% [95% CI, -9.1% to -2.9%]; P < .001); and from 19.9% to 3.7% 
      (absolute difference, -16.3%) for peer comparison (difference in differences, -5.2% 
      [95% CI, -6.9% to -1.6%]; P < .001). There were no statistically significant 
      interactions (neither synergy nor interference) between interventions. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: Among primary care practices, the use of accountable justification 
      and peer comparison as behavioral interventions resulted in lower rates of 
      inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections. TRIAL

TI  - Categorization of adverse drug reactions in electronic health records.

LID - e00550
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of adverse drug reaction (ADR) 
      documentation in a state-wide electronic health record (EHR), and to assess the 
      impact of the interface design on documentation accuracy and ability to provide 
      decision support. Data were extracted from 43 011 unique records in a state-wide 
      electronic health record in South Australia, Australia. Information obtained 
      included ADR coding as allergy or intolerance, allergen name, reaction, and 
      occupation of those entering data. Categorization into drug allergy or intolerance 
      was assessed for accuracy. Reactions were entered predominantly by nurses (60.1%), 
      also by doctors (31.0%) and pharmacists (6.1%). Of 27 314 reactions, 86.5% were 
      coded as allergy and 13.5% as intolerance. The majority (78.2%) described reactions 
      to drugs (as opposed to food, environmental or contact allergens), predominantly 
      chosen from the drug database (96.4%). Many entries used free text for the reaction 
      description (27.4%). Terms found in the predefined list under the allergy heading 
      were more likely to be categorized as allergy, even when the mechanism was 
      pharmacological intolerance. Only 45.1% (n = 1671/3705) of reactions consistent with 
      intolerance (eg, "nausea," "diarrhea") were correctly categorized as such, although 
      categorization by pharmacists was more accurate (P < .0001). These data suggest that 
      ADR categorization as allergy or intolerance is influenced by the EHR design. The 
      obligatory classification of ADRs into allergy or intolerance was not well 
      understood and does not appear to have practical benefit.

TI  - Identifying Suicidal Adolescents from Mental Health Records Using Natural Language 
      Processing.
PG  - 413-417
LID - 10.3233/SHTI190254 [doi]
AB  - Suicidal ideation is a risk factor for self-harm, completed suicide and can be 
      indicative of mental health issues. Adolescents are a particularly vulnerable group, 
      but few studies have examined suicidal behaviour prevalence in large cohorts. 
      Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are a rich source of secondary health care data 
      that could be used to estimate prevalence. Most EHR documentation related to suicide 
      risk is written in free text, thus requiring Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
      approaches. We adapted and evaluated a simple lexicon- and rule-based NLP approach 
      to identify suicidal adolescents from a large EHR database. We developed a 
      comprehensive manually annotated EHR reference standard and assessed NLP performance 
      at both document and patient level on data from 200 patients ( 5000 documents). We 
      achieved promising results (>80% f1 score at both document and patient level). 
      Simple NLP approaches can be successfully used to identify patients who exhibit 
      suicidal risk behaviour, and our proposed approach could be useful for other 
      populations and settings.

TI  - Natural language processing algorithms for mapping clinical text fragments onto 
      ontology concepts: a systematic review and recommendations for future studies.
PG  - 14
LID - 10.1186/s13326-020-00231-z [doi]
LID - 14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Free-text descriptions in electronic health records (EHRs) can be of 
      interest for clinical research and care optimization. However, free text cannot be 
      readily interpreted by a computer and, therefore, has limited value. Natural 
      Language Processing (NLP) algorithms can make free text machine-interpretable by 
      attaching ontology concepts to it. However, implementations of NLP algorithms are 
      not evaluated consistently. Therefore, the objective of this study was to review the 
      current methods used for developing and evaluating NLP algorithms that map clinical 
      text fragments onto ontology concepts. To standardize the evaluation of algorithms 
      and reduce heterogeneity between studies, we propose a list of recommendations. 
      METHODS: Two reviewers examined publications indexed by Scopus, IEEE, MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, the ACM Digital Library, and the ACL Anthology. Publications reporting on 
      NLP for mapping clinical text from EHRs to ontology concepts were included. Year, 
      country, setting, objective, evaluation and validation methods, NLP algorithms, 
      terminology systems, dataset size and language, performance measures, reference 
      standard, generalizability, operational use, and source code availability were 
      extracted. The studies' objectives were categorized by way of induction. These 
      results were used to define recommendations. RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred 
      fifty five unique studies were identified. Two hundred fifty six studies reported on 
      the development of NLP algorithms for mapping free text to ontology concepts. 
      Seventy-seven described development and evaluation. Twenty-two studies did not 
      perform a validation on unseen data and 68 studies did not perform external 
      validation. Of 23 studies that claimed that their algorithm was generalizable, 5 
      tested this by external validation. A list of sixteen recommendations regarding the 
      usage of NLP systems and algorithms, usage of data, evaluation and validation, 
      presentation of results, and generalizability of results was developed. CONCLUSION: 
      We found many heterogeneous approaches to the reporting on the development and 
      evaluation of NLP algorithms that map clinical text to ontology concepts. Over 
      one-fourth of the identified publications did not perform an evaluation. In 
      addition, over one-fourth of the included studies did not perform a validation, and 
      88% did not perform external validation. We believe that our recommendations, 
      alongside an existing reporting standard, will increase the reproducibility and 
      reusability of future studies and NLP algorithms in medicine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) are environmental 
      and behavioral factors that often impede disease management and result in sexually 
      transmitted infections. Despite their importance, SBDH are inconsistently documented 
      in electronic health records (EHRs) and typically collected only in an unstructured 
      format. Evidence suggests that structured data elements present in EHRs can 
      contribute further to identify SBDH in the patient record. OBJECTIVE: Explore the 
      automated inference of both the presence of SBDH documentation and individual SBDH 
      risk factors in patient records. Compare the relative ability of clinical notes and 
      structured EHR data, such as laboratory measurements and diagnoses, to support 
      inference. METHODS: We attempt to infer the presence of SBDH documentation in 
      patient records, as well as patient status of 11 SBDH, including alcohol abuse, 
      homelessness, and sexual orientation. We compare classification performance when 
      considering clinical notes only, structured data only, and notes and structured data 
      together. We perform an error analysis across several SBDH risk factors. RESULTS: 
      Classification models inferring the presence of SBDH documentation achieved good 
      performance (F1 score: 92.7-78.7; F1 considered as the primary evaluation metric). 
      Performance was variable for models inferring patient SBDH risk status; results 
      ranged from F1 = 82.7 for LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) status to 
      F1 = 28.5 for intravenous drug use. Error analysis demonstrated that lexical 
      diversity and documentation of historical SBDH status challenge inference of patient 
      SBDH status. Three of five classifiers inferring topic-specific SBDH documentation 
      and 10 of 11 patient SBDH status classifiers achieved highest performance when 
      trained using both clinical notes and structured data. CONCLUSION: Our findings 
      suggest that combining clinical free-text notes and structured data provide the best 
      approach in classifying patient SBDH status. Inferring patient SBDH status is most 
      challenging among SBDH with low prevalence and high lexical diversity.

TI  - Natural Language Processing in Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 900-908
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000004419 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically assess the application and 
      potential benefits of natural language processing (NLP) in surgical outcomes 
      research. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Widespread implementation of electronic health 
      records (EHRs) has generated a massive patient data source. Traditional methods of 
      data capture, such as billing codes and/or manual review of free-text narratives in 
      EHRs, are highly labor-intensive, costly, subjective, and potentially prone to bias. 
      METHODS: A literature search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase 
      identified all articles published starting in 2000 that used NLP models to assess 
      perioperative surgical outcomes. Evaluation metrics of NLP systems were assessed by 
      means of pooled analysis and meta-analysis. Qualitative synthesis was carried out to 
      assess the results and risk of bias on outcomes. RESULTS: The present study included 
      29 articles, with over half (n = 15) published after 2018. The most common outcome 
      identified using NLP was postoperative complications (n = 14). Compared to 
      traditional non-NLP models, NLP models identified postoperative complications with 
      higher sensitivity [0.92 (0.87-0.95) vs 0.58 (0.33-0.79), P < 0.001]. The 
      specificities were comparable at 0.99 (0.96-1.00) and 0.98 (0.95-0.99), 
      respectively. Using summary of likelihood ratio matrices, traditional non-NLP models 
      have clinical utility for confirming documentation of outcomes/diagnoses, whereas 
      NLP models may be reliably utilized for both confirming and ruling out documentation 
      of outcomes/diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: NLP usage to extract a range of surgical 
      outcomes, particularly postoperative complications, is accelerating across 
      disciplines and areas of clinical outcomes research. NLP and traditional non-NLP 
      approaches demonstrate similar performance measures, but NLP is superior in ruling 
      out documentation of surgical outcomes.

TI  - Using de-identified electronic health records to research mental health supported 
      housing services: A feasibility study.
PG  - e0237664

LID - e0237664
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental health supported housing services are a key component in the 
      rehabilitation of people with severe and complex needs. They are implemented widely 
      in the UK and other deinstitutionalised countries but there have been few empirical 
      studies of their effectiveness due to the logistic challenges and costs of standard 
      research methods. The Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) tool, developed to 
      de-identify and interrogate routinely recorded electronic health records, may 
      provide an alternative to evaluate supported housing services. METHODS: The 
      feasibility of using the Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust CRIS database to 
      identify a sample of users of mental health supported accommodation services. Two 
      approaches to data interrogation and case identification were compared; using 
      structured fields indicating individual's accommodation status, and iterative 
      development of free text searches of clinical notes referencing supported housing. 
      The data used were recorded over a 10-year-period (01-January-2008 to 
      31-December-2017). RESULTS: Both approaches were carried out by one full-time 
      researcher over four weeks (150 hours). Two structured fields indicating 
      accommodation status were found, 2,140 individuals had a value in at least one of 
      the fields representative of supported accommodation. The free text search of 
      clinical notes returned 21,103 records pertaining to 1,105 individuals. A manual 
      review of 10% of the notes indicated an estimated 733 of these individuals had used 
      a supported housing service, a positive predictive value of 66.4%. Over two-thirds 
      of the individuals returned in the free text search (768/1,105, 69.5%) were 
      identified via the structured fields approach. Although the estimated positive 
      predictive value was relatively high, a substantial proportion of the individuals 
      appearing only in the free text search (337/1,105, 30.5%) are likely to be false 
      positives. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible and requires minimal resources to use 
      de-identified electronic health record search tools to identify large samples of 
      users of mental health supported housing using structured and free text fields. 
      Further work is needed to establish the availability and completion of variables 
      relevant to specific clinical research questions in order to fully assess the 
      utility of electronic health records in evaluating the effectiveness of these 
      services.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite the availability of many frailty measures to identify older 
      adults at risk, frailty instruments are not routinely used for risk assessment in 
      population health management. Here, we assessed the potential value of electronic 
      health records (EHRs) and administrative claims in providing the necessary data for 
      variables used across various frailty instruments. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The 
      review focused on studies conducted worldwide. Participants included older people 
      aged 50 and older. DESIGN: We identified frailty instruments published between 2011 
      and 2018. Frailty variables used in each of the frailty instruments were extracted, 
      grouped, and categorized across health determinants and various clinical factors. 
      MEASURES: The availability of the extracted frailty variables across various data 
      sources (e.g., EHRs, administrative claims, and surveys) was evaluated by experts. 
      RESULTS: We identified 135 frailty instruments, which contained 593 unique 
      variables. Clinical determinants of health were the best represented variables 
      across frailty instruments (n = 516; 87 %), unlike social and health services 
      factors (n = 33; ∼5% and n = 32; ∼5%). Most frailty instruments require at least one 
      variable that is not routinely available in EHRs or claims (n = 113; ∼83 %). Only 22 
      frailty instruments have the potential to completely rely on EHR (structured or 
      free-text data) and/or claims data, and possibly be operationalized on a 
      population-level. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Frailty instruments continue to be 
      highly survey-based. More research is therefore needed to develop EHR-based frailty 
      instruments for population health management. This will permit organizations and 
      societies to stratify risk and better allocate resources among different older adult 
      populations.

AB  - Natural language processing (NLP) is a technology that uses computer-based 
      linguistics and artificial intelligence to identify and extract information from 
      free-text data sources such as progress notes, procedure and pathology reports, and 
      laboratory and radiologic test results. With the creation of large databases and the 
      trajectory of health care reform, NLP holds the promise of enhancing the 
      availability, quality, and utility of clinical information with the goal of 
      improving documentation, quality, and efficiency of health care in the United 
      States. To date, NLP has shown promise in automatically determining appropriate 
      colonoscopy intervals and identifying cases of inflammatory bowel disease from 
      electronic health records. The objectives of this review are to provide background 
      on NLP and its associated terminology, to describe how NLP has been used thus far in 
      the field of digestive diseases, and to identify its potential future uses.

TI  - Correlate: A PACS- and EHR-integrated Tool Leveraging Natural Language Processing to 
      Provide Automated Clinical Follow-up.
PG  - 1451-1460
LID - 10.1148/rg.2017160195 [doi]
AB  - A major challenge for radiologists is obtaining meaningful clinical follow-up 
      information for even a small percentage of cases encountered and dictated. 
      Traditional methods, such as keeping medical record number follow-up lists, 
      discussing cases with rounding clinical teams, and discussing cases at tumor boards, 
      are effective at keeping radiologists informed of clinical outcomes but are time 
      intensive and provide follow-up for a small subset of cases. To this end, the 
      authors developed a picture archiving and communication system-accessible electronic 
      health record (EHR)-integrated program called Correlate, which allows the user to 
      easily enter free-text search queries regarding desired clinical follow-up 
      information, with minimal interruption to the workflow. The program uses natural 
      language processing (NLP) to process the query and parse relevant future clinical 
      data from the EHR. Results are ordered in terms of clinical relevance, and the user 
      is e-mailed a link to results when these are available for viewing. A customizable 
      personal database of queries and results is also maintained for convenient future 
      access. Correlate aids radiologists in efficiently obtaining useful clinical 
      follow-up information that can improve patient care, help keep radiologists 
      integrated with other specialties and referring physicians, and provide valuable 
      experiential learning. The authors briefly review the history of automated clinical 
      follow-up tools and discuss the design and function of the Correlate program, which 
      uses NLP to perform intelligent prospective searches of the EHR. (©) RSNA, 2017.

TI  - Evidence of Gender Differences in the Diagnosis and Management of Coronavirus 
      Disease 2019 Patients: An Analysis of Electronic Health Records Using Natural 
      Language Processing and Machine Learning.
PG  - 393-404

AB  - Background: The impact of sex and gender in the incidence and severity of 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains controversial. Here, we aim to describe 
      the characteristics of COVID-19 patients at disease onset, with special focus on the 
      diagnosis and management of female patients with COVID-19. Methods: We explored the 
      unstructured free text in the electronic health records (EHRs) within the SESCAM 
      Healthcare Network (Castilla La-Mancha, Spain). The study sample comprised the 
      entire population with available EHRs (1,446,452 patients) from January 1st to May 
      1st, 2020. We extracted patients' clinical information upon diagnosis, progression, 
      and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. Results: A total of 4,780 patients with a 
      confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 2,443 (51%) were female, 
      who were on average 1.5 years younger than male patients (61.7 ± 19.4 vs. 
      63.3 ± 18.3, p = 0.0025). There were more female COVID-19 cases in the 
      15-59-year-old interval, with the greatest sex ratio (95% confidence interval) 
      observed in the 30-39-year-old range (1.69; 1.35-2.11). Upon diagnosis, headache, 
      anosmia, and ageusia were significantly more frequent in females than males. Imaging 
      by chest X-ray or blood tests were performed less frequently in females (65.5% vs. 
      78.3% and 49.5% vs. 63.7%, respectively), all p < 0.001. Regarding hospital resource 
      use, females showed less frequency of hospitalization (44.3% vs. 62.0%) and 
      intensive care unit admission (2.8% vs. 6.3%) than males, all p < 0.001. Conclusion: 
      Our results indicate important sex-dependent differences in the diagnosis, clinical 
      manifestation, and treatment of patients with COVID-19. These results warrant 
      further research to identify and close the gender gap in the ongoing pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of clinical data in electronic health records for 
      machine-learning or data analytics depends on the conversion of free text into 
      machine-readable codes. We have examined the feasibility of capturing the 
      neurological examination as machine-readable codes based on UMLS Metathesaurus 
      concepts. METHODS: We created a target ontology for capturing the neurological 
      examination using 1100 concepts from the UMLS Metathesaurus. We created a dataset of 
      2386 test-phrases based on 419 published neurological cases. We then mapped the 
      test-phrases to the target ontology. RESULTS: We were able to map all of the 2386 
      test-phrases to 601 unique UMLS concepts. A neurological examination ontology with 
      1100 concepts has sufficient breadth and depth of coverage to encode all of the 
      neurologic concepts derived from the 419 test cases. Using only pre-coordinated 
      concepts, component ontologies of the UMLS, such as HPO, SNOMED CT, and OMIM, do not 
      have adequate depth and breadth of coverage to encode the complexity of the 
      neurological examination. CONCLUSION: An ontology based on a subset of UMLS has 
      sufficient breadth and depth of coverage to convert deficits from the neurological 
      examination into machine-readable codes using pre-coordinated concepts. The use of a 
      small subset of UMLS concepts for a neurological examination ontology offers the 
      advantage of improved manageability as well as the opportunity to curate the 
      hierarchy and subsumption relationships.

AB  - Informatics tools to extract and analyze clinical information on patients have 
      lagged behind data-mining developments in bioinformatics. While the analyses of an 
      individual's partial or complete genotype is nearly a reality, the phenotypic 
      characteristics that accompany the genotype are not well known and largely 
      inaccessible in free-text patient health records. As the adoption of electronic 
      medical records increases, there exists an urgent need to extract pertinent 
      phenotypic information and make that available to clinicians and researchers. This 
      usually requires the data to be in a structured format that is both searchable and 
      amenable to computation. Using inflammatory bowel disease as an example, this study 
      demonstrates the utility of a natural language processing system (MedLEE) in mining 
      clinical notes in the paperless VA Health Care System. This adaptation of MedLEE is 
      useful for identifying patients with specific clinical conditions, those at risk for 
      or those with symptoms suggestive of those conditions.

AB  - During the last two decades, improving the quality and safety of healthcare has 
      become a focus in rheumatology. Widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) 
      and the availability of digital data have the potential to drive quality 
      improvement, improve patient outcomes, and prevent adverse events. In the coming 
      years, developing and leveraging tools within the EHR will be the key to making the 
      next big strides in improving the health of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 
      other rheumatic diseases, including building EHR infrastructure to capture patient 
      outcomes and developing automated methods to retrieve information from free text of 
      clinical notes.

TI  - Use of Electronic Health Records by Nurses for Symptom Management in Inpatient 
      Settings: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 465-472
LID - 10.1097/CIN.0000000000000329 [doi]
AB  - Symptom management is one of the essential functions of nurses in inpatient 
      settings; yet, little is understood about the manner in which nurses use electronic 
      health records for symptom documentation. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic 
      review is to characterize nurses' use of electronic health records for documentation 
      of symptom assessment and management in inpatient settings, to inform design studies 
      that better support electronic health records for patient symptom management by 
      nurses. We searched the Ovid Medline (1946-current), Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
      Allied Health Literature (EBSCO, 1981-current), and Excerpta Medica Database 
      (Embase.com, 1974-current) databases from inception through May 2015 using multiple 
      subject headings and "free text" key words, representing the concepts of electronic 
      medical records, symptom documentation, and inpatient setting. One thousand nine 
      hundred eighty-two articles were returned from the search. Eighteen publications 
      from the years 2003 to 2014 were included after abstract and full text review. 
      Studies heavily focused on a pain as symptom. Nurses face challenges when using 
      electronic health records that can threaten quality and safety of care. Clinical, 
      design, and administrative recommendations were identified to overcome the 
      challenges of nurses' electronic health record use. A call for interdisciplinary, 
      comprehensive, systematic interventions and user-centered design of information 
      systems is needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the best papers in the field of Knowledge Representation and 
      Management (KRM). METHODS: A comprehensive review of medical informatics literature 
      was performed to select some of the most interesting papers of KRM and natural 
      language processing (NLP) published in 2013. RESULTS: Four articles were selected, 
      one focuses on Electronic Health Record (EHR) interoperability for clinical pathway 
      personalization based on structured data. The other three focus on NLP (corpus 
      creation, de-identification, and co-reference resolution) and highlight the increase 
      in NLP tools performances. CONCLUSION: NLP tools are close to being seriously 
      concurrent to humans in some annotation tasks. Their use could increase drastically 
      the amount of data usable for meaningful use of EHR.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) are being increasingly utilized and form a unique 
      source of extensive data gathered during routine clinical care. Through use of 
      codified and free text concepts identified using clinical informatics tools, disease 
      labels can be assigned with a high degree of accuracy. Analysis linking such 
      EHR-assigned disease labels to a biospecimen repository has demonstrated that 
      genetic associations identified in prospective cohorts can be replicated with 
      adequate statistical power and novel phenotypic associations identified. In 
      addition, genetic discovery research can be performed utilizing clinical, 
      laboratory, and procedure data obtained during care. Challenges with such research 
      include the need to tackle variability in quality and quantity of EHR data and 
      importance of maintaining patient privacy and data security. With appropriate 
      safeguards, this novel and emerging field of research offers considerable promise 
      and potential to further scientific research in gastroenterology efficiently, 
      cost-effectively, and with engagement of patients and communities.

TI  - Text Mining of Electronic Health Records Can Accurately Identify and Characterize 
      Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
PG  - 65-71
LID - 10.1002/acr2.11211 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being recognized as a 
      major source of data reusable for medical research and quality monitoring, although 
      patient identification and assessment of symptoms (characterization) remain 
      challenging, especially in complex diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus 
      (SLE). Current coding systems are unable to assess information recorded in the 
      physician's free-text notes. This study shows that text mining can be used as a 
      reliable alternative. METHODS: In a multidisciplinary research team of data 
      scientists and medical experts, a text mining algorithm on 4607 patient records was 
      developed to assess the diagnosis of 14 different immune-mediated inflammatory 
      diseases and the presence of 18 different symptoms in the EHR. The text mining 
      algorithm included key words in the EHR, while mining the context for exclusion 
      phrases. The accuracy of the text mining algorithm was assessed by manually checking 
      the EHR of 100 random patients suspected of having SLE for diagnoses and symptoms 
      and comparing the outcome with the outcome of the text mining algorithm. RESULTS: 
      After evaluation of 100 patient records, the text mining algorithm had a sensitivity 
      of 96.4% and a specificity of 93.3% in assessing the presence of SLE. The algorithm 
      detected potentially life-threatening symptoms (nephritis, pleuritis) with good 
      sensitivity (80%-82%) and high specificity (97%-97%). CONCLUSION: We present a text 
      mining algorithm that can accurately identify and characterize patients with SLE 
      using routinely collected data from the EHR. Our study shows that using text mining, 
      data from the EHR can be reused in research and quality control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: CDK4/6 inhibitors plus endocrine therapies are the current standard of 
      care in the first-line treatment of HR+/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, but 
      there are no well-established clinical or molecular predictive factors for patient 
      response. In the era of personalised oncology, new approaches for developing 
      predictive models of response are needed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data derived from 
      the electronic health records (EHRs) of real-world patients with HR+/HER2-negative 
      advanced breast cancer were used to develop predictive models for early and late 
      progression to first-line treatment. Two machine learning approaches were used: a 
      classic approach using a data set of manually extracted features from reviewed (EHR) 
      patients, and a second approach using natural language processing (NLP) of free-text 
      clinical notes recorded during medical visits. RESULTS: Of the 610 patients 
      included, there were 473 (77.5%) progressions to first-line treatment, of which 126 
      (20.6%) occurred within the first 6 months. There were 152 patients (24.9%) who 
      showed no disease progression before 28 months from the onset of first-line 
      treatment. The best predictive model for early progression using the manually 
      extracted dataset achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.734 (95% CI 
      0.687-0.782). Using the NLP free-text processing approach, the best model obtained 
      an AUC of 0.758 (95% CI 0.714-0.800). The best model to predict long responders 
      using manually extracted data obtained an AUC of 0.669 (95% CI 0.608-0.730). With 
      NLP free-text processing, the best model attained an AUC of 0.752 (95% CI 
      0.705-0.799). CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning methods, we developed predictive 
      models for early and late progression to first-line treatment of HR+/HER2-negative 
      metastatic breast cancer, also finding that NLP-based machine learning models are 
      slightly better than predictive models based on manually obtained data.

AB  - In recent years, machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to 
      analysis of patient symptom data in the context of disease diagnosis, at least where 
      such data is well codified. However, much of the data present in Electronic Health 
      Records (EHR) is unlikely to prove suitable for classic machine learning approaches. 
      In particular, the use of free (or unstructured) text for clinical notes presents 
      significant analytical opportunities, but also unique difficulties. Furthermore, the 
      wide dispersal of health data relating to individuals necessitates the development 
      of decentralized solutions. We provide, in this paper, an overview of our approach 
      to develop a neural network framework for patient classification in the environment 
      of EHRs where data may be heterogeneous, incomplete (containing missing values), and 
      noisy. In this paper we describe our system which provides prediction of outlier 
      cases which are likely to relate to frequent attender patients, which acheives an 
      Area-Under-the-Curve score of up to 0.92.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A wealth of clinical information is buried in free text of electronic 
      health records (EHR), and converting clinical information to machine-understandable 
      form is crucial for the secondary use of EHRs. Laboratory test results, as one of 
      the most important types of clinical information, are written in various styles in 
      free text of EHRs. This has brought great difficulties for data integration and 
      utilization of EHRs. Therefore, developing technology to normalize different 
      expressions of laboratory test results in free text is indispensable for the 
      secondary use of EHRs. METHODS: In this study, we developed a knowledge-based method 
      named LATTE (transforming lab test results), which could transform various 
      expressions of laboratory test results into a normalized and machine-understandable 
      format. We first identified the analyte of a laboratory test result with a 
      dictionary-based method and then designed a series of rules to detect information 
      associated with the analyte, including its specimen, measured value, unit of 
      measure, conclusive phrase and sampling factor. We determined whether a test result 
      is normal or abnormal by understanding the meaning of conclusive phrases or by 
      comparing its measured value with an appropriate normal range. Finally, we converted 
      various expressions of laboratory test results, either in numeric or textual form, 
      into a normalized form as "specimen-analyte-abnormality". With this method, a 
      laboratory test with the same type of abnormality would have the same 
      representation, regardless of the way that it is mentioned in free text. RESULTS: 
      LATTE was developed and optimized on a training set including 8894 laboratory test 
      results from 756 EHRs, and evaluated on a test set including 3740 laboratory test 
      results from 210 EHRs. Compared to experts' annotations, LATTE achieved a precision 
      of 0.936, a recall of 0.897 and an F1 score of 0.916 on the training set, and a 
      precision of 0.892, a recall of 0.843 and an F1 score of 0.867 on the test set. For 
      223 laboratory tests with at least two different expression forms in the test set, 
      LATTE transformed 85.7% (2870/3350) of laboratory test results into a normalized 
      form. Besides, LATTE achieved F1 scores above 0.8 for EHRs from 18 of 21 different 
      hospital departments, indicating its generalization capabilities in normalizing 
      laboratory test results. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, LATTE is an effective method for 
      normalizing various expressions of laboratory test results in free text of EHRs. 
      LATTE will facilitate EHR-based applications such as cohort querying, patient 
      clustering and machine learning. AVAILABILITY: LATTE is freely available for 
      download on GitHub (https://github.com/denglizong/LATTE).

LID - 14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Automated machine-learning systems are able to de-identify electronic 
      medical records, including free-text clinical notes. Use of such systems would 
      greatly boost the amount of data available to researchers, yet their deployment has 
      been limited due to uncertainty about their performance when applied to new 
      datasets. OBJECTIVE: We present practical options for clinical note 
      de-identification, assessing performance of machine learning systems ranging from 
      off-the-shelf to fully customized. METHODS: We implement a state-of-the-art machine 
      learning de-identification system, training and testing on pairs of datasets that 
      match the deployment scenarios. We use clinical notes from two i2b2 competition 
      corpora, the Physionet Gold Standard corpus, and parts of the MIMIC-III dataset. 
      RESULTS: Fully customized systems remove 97-99% of personally identifying 
      information. Performance of off-the-shelf systems varies by dataset, with 
      performance mostly above 90%. Providing a small labeled dataset or large unlabeled 
      dataset allows for fine-tuning that improves performance over off-the-shelf systems. 
      CONCLUSION: Health organizations should be aware of the levels of customization 
      available when selecting a de-identification deployment solution, in order to choose 
      the one that best matches their resources and target performance level.

TI  - Assessing stroke severity using electronic health record data: a machine learning 
      approach.
PG  - 8
LID - 10.1186/s12911-019-1010-x [doi]
LID - 8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke severity is an important predictor of patient outcomes and is 
      commonly measured with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 
      scores. Because these scores are often recorded as free text in physician reports, 
      structured real-world evidence databases seldom include the severity. The aim of 
      this study was to use machine learning models to impute NIHSS scores for all 
      patients with newly diagnosed stroke from multi-institution electronic health record 
      (EHR) data. METHODS: NIHSS scores available in the Optum© de-identified Integrated 
      Claims-Clinical dataset were extracted from physician notes by applying natural 
      language processing (NLP) methods. The cohort analyzed in the study consists of the 
      7149 patients with an inpatient or emergency room diagnosis of ischemic stroke, 
      hemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischemic attack and a corresponding NLP-extracted 
      NIHSS score. A subset of these patients (n = 1033, 14%) were held out for 
      independent validation of model performance and the remaining patients (n = 6116, 
      86%) were used for training the model. Several machine learning models were 
      evaluated, and parameters optimized using cross-validation on the training set. The 
      model with optimal performance, a random forest model, was ultimately evaluated on 
      the holdout set. RESULTS: Leveraging machine learning we identified the main factors 
      in electronic health record data for assessing stroke severity, including death 
      within the same month as stroke occurrence, length of hospital stay following stroke 
      occurrence, aphagia/dysphagia diagnosis, hemiplegia diagnosis, and whether a patient 
      was discharged to home or self-care. Comparing the imputed NIHSS scores to the 
      NLP-extracted NIHSS scores on the holdout data set yielded an R(2) (coefficient of 
      determination) of 0.57, an R (Pearson correlation coefficient) of 0.76, and a 
      root-mean-squared error of 4.5. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models built on EHR 
      data can be used to determine proxies for stroke severity. This enables severity to 
      be incorporated in studies of stroke patient outcomes using administrative and EHR 
      databases.

AB  - The process of documentation is one of the most important parts of electronic health 
      records (EHR). It is time-consuming, and up until now, available documentation 
      procedures have not been able to overcome this type of EHR limitations. Thus, 
      entering information into EHR still has remained a challenge. In this study, by 
      applying the trigram language model, we presented a method to predict the next words 
      while typing free texts. It is hypothesized that using this system may save typing 
      time of free text. The words prediction model introduced in this research was 
      trained and tested on the free texts regarding to colonoscopy, transesophageal 
      echocardiogram, and anterior-cervical-decompression. Required time of typing for 
      each of the above-mentioned reports calculated and compared with manual typing of 
      the same words. It is revealed that 33.36% reduction in typing time and 73.53% 
      reduction in keystroke. The designed system reduced the time of typing free text 
      which might be an approach for EHRs improvement in terms of documentation.

TI  - Natural Language Processing and Its Implications for the Future of Medication 
      Safety: A Narrative Review of Recent Advances and Challenges.
PG  - 822-841
LID - 10.1002/phar.2151 [doi]
AB  - The safety of medication use has been a priority in the United States since the late 
      1930s. Recently, it has gained prominence due to the increasing amount of data 
      suggesting that a large amount of patient harm is preventable and can be mitigated 
      with effective risk strategies that have not been sufficiently adopted. Adverse 
      events from medications are part of clinical practice, but the ability to identify a 
      patient's risk and to minimize that risk must be a priority. The ability to identify 
      adverse events has been a challenge due to limitations of available data sources, 
      which are often free text. The use of natural language processing (NLP) may help to 
      address these limitations. NLP is the artificial intelligence domain of computer 
      science that uses computers to manipulate unstructured data (i.e., narrative text or 
      speech data) in the context of a specific task. In this narrative review, we 
      illustrate the fundamentals of NLP and discuss NLP's application to medication 
      safety in four data sources: electronic health records, Internet-based data, 
      published literature, and reporting systems. Given the magnitude of available data 
      from these sources, a growing area is the use of computer algorithms to help 
      automatically detect associations between medications and adverse effects. The main 
      benefit of NLP is in the time savings associated with automation of various 
      medication safety tasks such as the medication reconciliation process facilitated by 
      computers, as well as the potential for near-real-time identification of adverse 
      events for postmarketing surveillance such as those posted on social media that 
      would otherwise go unanalyzed. NLP is limited by a lack of data sharing between 
      health care organizations due to insufficient interoperability capabilities, 
      inhibiting large-scale adverse event monitoring across populations. We anticipate 
      that future work in this area will focus on the integration of data sources from 
      different domains to improve the ability to identify potential adverse events more 
      quickly and to improve clinical decision support with regard to a patient's 
      estimated risk for specific adverse events at the time of medication prescription or 
      review.

TI  - Identifying Veterans Using Electronic Health Records in the United Kingdom: A 
      Feasibility Study.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare8010001 [doi]
LID - 1
AB  - There is a lack of quantitative evidence concerning UK (United Kingdom) Armed Forces 
      (AF) veterans who access secondary mental health care services-specialist care often 
      delivered in high intensity therapeutic clinics or hospitals-for their mental health 
      difficulties. The current study aimed to investigate the utility and feasibility of 
      identifying veterans accessing secondary mental health care services using National 
      Health Service (NHS) electronic health records (EHRs) in the UK. Veterans were 
      manually identified using the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system-a 
      database holding secondary mental health care EHRs for an NHS Trust in the UK. We 
      systematically and manually searched CRIS for veterans, by applying a 
      military-related key word search strategy to the free-text clinical notes completed 
      by clinicians. Relevant data on veterans' socio-demographic characteristics, mental 
      disorder diagnoses and treatment pathways through care were extracted for analysis. 
      This study showed that it is feasible, although time consuming, to identify veterans 
      through CRIS. Using the military-related key word search strategy identified 1600 
      potential veteran records. Following manual review, 693 (43.3%) of these records 
      were verified as "probable" veterans and used for analysis. They had a median age of 
      74 years (interquartile range (IQR): 53-86); the majority were male (90.8%) and 
      lived alone (38.0%). The most common mental diagnoses overall were depressive 
      disorders (22.9%), followed by alcohol use disorders (10.5%). Differences in care 
      pathways were observed between pre and post national service (NS) era veterans. This 
      feasibility study represents a first step in showing that it is possible to identify 
      veterans through free-text clinical notes. It is also the first to compare veterans 
      from pre and post NS era.

AB  - In line with the current trajectory of healthcare reform, significant emphasis has 
      been placed on improving the utilization of data collected during a clinical 
      encounter. Although the structured fields of electronic health records have provided 
      a convenient foundation on which to begin such efforts, it was well understood that 
      a substantial portion of relevant information is confined in the free-text 
      narratives documenting care. Unfortunately, extracting meaningful information from 
      such narratives is a non-trivial task, traditionally requiring significant manual 
      effort. Today, computational approaches from a field known as Natural Language 
      Processing (NLP) are poised to make a transformational impact in the analysis and 
      utilization of these documents across healthcare practice and research, particularly 
      in procedure-heavy sub-disciplines such as gastroenterology (GI). As such, this 
      manuscript provides a clinically focused review of NLP systems in GI practice. It 
      begins with a detailed synopsis around the state of NLP techniques, presenting 
      state-of-the-art methods and typical use cases in both clinical settings and across 
      other domains. Next, it will present a robust literature review around current 
      applications of NLP within four prominent areas of gastroenterology including 
      endoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreaticobiliary, and liver diseases. 
      Finally, it concludes with a discussion of open problems and future opportunities of 
      this technology in the field of gastroenterology and health care as a whole.

TI  - Extracting information from the text of electronic medical records to improve case 
      detection: a systematic review.
PG  - 1007-15
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv180 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic medical records (EMRs) are revolutionizing health-related 
      research. One key issue for study quality is the accurate identification of patients 
      with the condition of interest. Information in EMRs can be entered as structured 
      codes or unstructured free text. The majority of research studies have used only 
      coded parts of EMRs for case-detection, which may bias findings, miss cases, and 
      reduce study quality. This review examines whether incorporating information from 
      text into case-detection algorithms can improve research quality. METHODS: A 
      systematic search returned 9659 papers, 67 of which reported on the extraction of 
      information from free text of EMRs with the stated purpose of detecting cases of a 
      named clinical condition. Methods for extracting information from text and the 
      technical accuracy of case-detection algorithms were reviewed. RESULTS: Studies 
      mainly used US hospital-based EMRs, and extracted information from text for 41 
      conditions using keyword searches, rule-based algorithms, and machine learning 
      methods. There was no clear difference in case-detection algorithm accuracy between 
      rule-based and machine learning methods of extraction. Inclusion of information from 
      text resulted in a significant improvement in algorithm sensitivity and area under 
      the receiver operating characteristic in comparison to codes alone (median 
      sensitivity 78% (codes + text) vs 62% (codes), P = .03; median area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic 95% (codes + text) vs 88% (codes), P = .025). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Text in EMRs is accessible, especially with open source information 
      extraction algorithms, and significantly improves case detection when combined with 
      codes. More harmonization of reporting within EMR studies is needed, particularly 
      standardized reporting of algorithm accuracy metrics like positive predictive value 
      (precision) and sensitivity (recall).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vancomycin, the most common antimicrobial used in US hospitals, can 
      cause diverse adverse reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). Yet, 
      little is known about vancomycin reactions documented in electronic health records. 
      OBJECTIVE: To describe vancomycin HSR epidemiology from electronic health record 
      allergy data. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of patients with 1 or more 
      encounter from 2017 to 2019 and an electronic health record vancomycin drug allergy 
      label (DAL) in 2 US health care systems. We determined prevalence and trends of 
      vancomycin DALs and assessed active DALs by HSR phenotype determined from structured 
      (coded) and unstructured (free-text) data using natural language processing. We 
      investigated demographic associations with documentation of vancomycin red man 
      syndrome (RMS). RESULTS: Among 4,490,618 patients, 14,426 (0.3%) had a vancomycin 
      DAL with 18,761 documented reactions (2,248 [12.0%] free-text). Quarterly mean 
      vancomycin DALs added were 253 ± 12 and deleted were 12 ± 2. Of 18,761 vancomycin 
      HSRs, 7,903 (42.1%) were immediate phenotypes and 3,881 (20.7%) were delayed 
      phenotypes. Common HSRs were rash (32% of HSRs) and RMS (16% of HSRs). Anaphylaxis 
      was coded in 6% cases of HSRs. Drug reaction eosinophilia and systemic symptoms 
      syndrome was the most common coded vancomycin severe cutaneous adverse reaction. RMS 
      documentation was more likely for males (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.17-1.44) and 
      less likely for blacks (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.75). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Vancomycin causes diverse adverse reactions, including common (eg, RMS) and severe 
      (eg, drug reaction eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome) reactions entered as 
      DAL free-text. Anaphylaxis comprised 6% of documented vancomycin HSRs, although true 
      vancomycin IgE-mediated reactions are exceedingly rare. Improving vancomycin DAL 
      documentation requires more coded entry options, including a coded entry for RMS.

      disease progression.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electronic health record (EHR) systems contain structured data (such as 
      diagnostic codes) and unstructured data (clinical documentation). Clinical insights 
      can be derived from analyzing both. The use of natural language processing (NLP) 
      algorithms to effectively analyze unstructured data has been well demonstrated. Here 
      we examine the utility of NLP for the identification of patients with non-alcoholic 
      fatty liver disease, assess patterns of disease progression, and identify gaps in 
      care related to breakdown in communication among providers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      All clinical notes available on the 38,575 patients enrolled in the Mount Sinai 
      BioMe cohort were loaded into the NLP system. We compared analysis of structured and 
      unstructured EHR data using NLP, free-text search, and diagnostic codes with 
      validation against expert adjudication. We then used the NLP findings to measure 
      physician impression of progression from early-stage NAFLD to NASH or cirrhosis. 
      Similarly, we used the same NLP findings to identify mentions of NAFLD in radiology 
      reports that did not persist into clinical notes. RESULTS: Out of 38,575 patients, 
      we identified 2,281 patients with NAFLD. From the remainder, 10,653 patients with 
      similar data density were selected as a control group. NLP outperformed ICD and text 
      search in both sensitivity (NLP: 0.93, ICD: 0.28, text search: 0.81) and F2 score 
      (NLP: 0.92, ICD: 0.34, text search: 0.81). Of 2281 NAFLD patients, 673 (29.5%) were 
      believed to have progressed to NASH or cirrhosis. Among 176 where NAFLD was noted 
      prior to NASH, the average progression time was 410 days. 619 (27.1%) NAFLD patients 
      had it documented only in radiology notes and not acknowledged in other forms of 
      clinical documentation. Of these, 170 (28.4%) were later identified as having likely 
      developed NASH or cirrhosis after a median 1057.3 days. DISCUSSION: NLP-based 
      approaches were more accurate at identifying NAFLD within the EHR than ICD/text 
      search-based approaches. Suspected NAFLD on imaging is often not acknowledged in 
      subsequent clinical documentation. Many such patients are later found to have more 
      advanced liver disease. Analysis of information flows demonstrated loss of key 
      information that could have been used to help prevent the progression of early NAFLD 
      (NAFL) to NASH or cirrhosis. CONCLUSION: For identification of NAFLD, NLP performed 
      better than alternative selection modalities. It then facilitated analysis of 
      knowledge flow between physician and enabled the identification of breakdowns where 
      key information was lost that could have slowed or prevented later disease 
      progression.

TI  - Natural Language Processing for Mimicking Clinical Trial Recruitment in Critical 
      Care: A Semi-Automated Simulation Based on the LeoPARDS Trial.
PG  - 2950-2959
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2020.2977925 [doi]
AB  - Clinical trials often fail to recruit an adequate number of appropriate patients. 
      Identifying eligible trial participants is resource-intensive when relying on manual 
      review of clinical notes, particularly in critical care settings where the time 
      window is short. Automated review of electronic health records (EHR) may help, but 
      much of the information is in free text rather than a computable form. We applied 
      natural language processing (NLP) to free text EHR data using the CogStack platform 
      to simulate recruitment into the LeoPARDS study, a clinical trial aiming to reduce 
      organ dysfunction in septic shock. We applied an algorithm to identify eligible 
      patients using a moving 1-hour time window, and compared patients identified by our 
      approach with those actually screened and recruited for the trial, for the time 
      period that data were available. We manually reviewed records of a random sample of 
      patients identified by the algorithm but not screened in the original trial. Our 
      method identified 376 patients, including 34 patients with EHR data available who 
      were actually recruited to LeoPARDS in our centre. The sensitivity of CogStack for 
      identifying patients screened was 90% (95% CI 85%, 93%). Of the 203 patients 
      identified by both manual screening and CogStack, the index date matched in 95 (47%) 
      and CogStack was earlier in 94 (47%). In conclusion, analysis of EHR data using NLP 
      could effectively replicate recruitment in a critical care trial, and identify some 
      eligible patients at an earlier stage, potentially improving trial recruitment if 
      implemented in real time.

      mutation-associated cancer treatment change from patient progress notes.
PG  - 139-149
LID - 10.1093/jamiaopen/ooy061 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning approaches were 
      used to build classifiers to identify genomic-related treatment changes in the 
      free-text visit progress notes of cancer patients. METHODS: We obtained 5889 
      deidentified progress reports (2439 words on average) for 755 cancer patients who 
      have undergone a clinical next generation sequencing (NGS) testing in Wake Forest 
      Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center for our data analyses. An NLP system was 
      implemented to process the free-text data and extract NGS-related information. Three 
      types of recurrent neural network (RNN) namely, gated recurrent unit, long 
      short-term memory (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM (LSTM_Bi) were applied to classify 
      documents to the treatment-change and no-treatment-change groups. Further, we 
      compared the performances of RNNs to 5 machine learning algorithms including Naive 
      Bayes, K-nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine for classification, Random forest, 
      and Logistic Regression. RESULTS: Our results suggested that, overall, RNNs 
      outperformed traditional machine learning algorithms, and LSTM_Bi showed the best 
      performance among the RNNs in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. In 
      addition, pretrained word embedding can improve the accuracy of LSTM by 3.4% and 
      reduce the training time by more than 60%. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: NLP and 
      RNN-based text mining solutions have demonstrated advantages in information 
      retrieval and document classification tasks for unstructured clinical progress 
      notes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Temporal relations between clinical events play an important role in 
      clinical assessment and decision making. Extracting such relations from free text 
      data is a challenging task because it lies on between medical natural language 
      processing, temporal representation and temporal reasoning. OBJECTIVES: To survey 
      existing methods for extracting temporal relations (TLINKs) between events from 
      clinical free text in English; to establish the state-of-the-art in this field; and 
      to identify outstanding methodological challenges. METHODS: A systematic search in 
      PubMed and the DBLP computer science bibliography was conducted for studies 
      published between January 2006 and December 2018. The relevant studies were 
      identified by examining the titles and abstracts. Then, the full text of selected 
      studies was analyzed in depth and information were collected on TLINK tasks, TLINK 
      types, data sources, features selection, methods used, and reported performance. 
      RESULTS: A total of 2834 publications were identified for title and abstract 
      screening. Of these publications, 51 studies were selected. Thirty-two studies used 
      machine learning approaches, 15 studies used a hybrid approaches, and only four 
      studies used a rule-based approach. The majority of studies use publicly available 
      corpora: THYME (28 studies) and the i2b2 corpus (17 studies). CONCLUSION: The 
      performance of TLINK extraction methods ranges widely depending on relation types 
      and events (e.g. from 32% to 87% F-score for identifying relations between clinical 
      events and document creation time). A small set of TLINKs (before, after, overlap 
      and contains) has been widely studied with relatively good performance, whereas 
      other types of TLINK (e.g., started by, finished by, precedes) are rarely studied 
      and remain challenging. Machine learning classifiers (such as Support Vector Machine 
      and Conditional Random Fields) and Deep Neural Networks were among the best 
      performing methods for extracting TLINKs, but nearly all the work has been carried 
      out and tested on two publicly available corpora only. The field would benefit from 
      the availability of more publicly available, high-quality, annotated clinical text 
      corpora.

TI  - Machine Learning Electronic Health Record Identification of Patients with Rheumatoid 
      Arthritis: Algorithm Pipeline Development and Validation Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Financial codes are often used to extract diagnoses from electronic 
      health records. This approach is prone to false positives. Alternatively, queries 
      are constructed, but these are highly center and language specific. A tantalizing 
      alternative is the automatic identification of patients by employing machine 
      learning on format-free text entries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to 
      develop an easily implementable workflow that builds a machine learning algorithm 
      capable of accurately identifying patients with rheumatoid arthritis from 
      format-free text fields in electronic health records. METHODS: Two electronic health 
      record data sets were employed: Leiden (n=3000) and Erlangen (n=4771). Using a 
      portion of the Leiden data (n=2000), we compared 6 different machine learning 
      methods and a naïve word-matching algorithm using 10-fold cross-validation. 
      Performances were compared using the area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC), 
      and F1 score was used as the primary criterion for selecting the best method to 
      build a classifying algorithm. We selected the optimal threshold of positive 
      predictive value for case identification based on the output of the best method in 
      the training data. This validation workflow was subsequently applied to a portion of 
      the Erlangen data (n=4293). For testing, the best performing methods were applied to 
      remaining data (Leiden n=1000; Erlangen n=478) for an unbiased evaluation. RESULTS: 
      For the Leiden data set, the word-matching algorithm demonstrated mixed performance 
      (AUROC 0.90; AUPRC 0.33; F1 score 0.55), and 4 methods significantly outperformed 
      word-matching, with support vector machines performing best (AUROC 0.98; AUPRC 0.88; 
      F1 score 0.83). Applying this support vector machine classifier to the test data 
      resulted in a similarly high performance (F1 score 0.81; positive predictive value 
      [PPV] 0.94), and with this method, we could identify 2873 patients with rheumatoid 
      arthritis in less than 7 seconds out of the complete collection of 23,300 patients 
      in the Leiden electronic health record system. For the Erlangen data set, gradient 
      boosting performed best (AUROC 0.94; AUPRC 0.85; F1 score 0.82) in the training set, 
      and applied to the test data, resulted once again in good results (F1 score 0.67; 
      PPV 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that machine learning methods can extract the 
      records of patients with rheumatoid arthritis from electronic health record data 
      with high precision, allowing research on very large populations for limited costs. 
      Our approach is language and center independent and could be applied to any type of 
      diagnosis. We have developed our pipeline into a universally applicable and 
      easy-to-implement workflow to equip centers with their own high-performing 
      algorithm. This allows the creation of observational studies of unprecedented size 
      covering different countries for low cost from already available data in electronic 
      health record systems.

AB  - CONTEXT: Goals-of-care discussions are an important quality metric in palliative 
      care. However, goals-of-care discussions are often documented as free text in 
      diverse locations. It is difficult to identify these discussions in the electronic 
      health record (EHR) efficiently. OBJECTIVES: To develop, train, and test an 
      automated approach to identifying goals-of-care discussions in the EHR, using 
      natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). METHODS: From the 
      electronic health records of an academic health system, we collected a purposive 
      sample of 3183 EHR notes (1435 inpatient notes and 1748 outpatient notes) from 1426 
      patients with serious illness over 2008-2016, and manually reviewed each note for 
      documentation of goals-of-care discussions. Separately, we developed a program to 
      identify notes containing documentation of goals-of-care discussions using NLP and 
      supervised ML. We estimated the performance characteristics of the NLP/ML program 
      across 100 pairs of randomly partitioned training and test sets. We repeated these 
      methods for inpatient-only and outpatient-only subsets. RESULTS: Of 3183 notes, 689 
      contained documentation of goals-of-care discussions. The mean sensitivity of the 
      NLP/ML program was 82.3% (SD 3.2%), and the mean specificity was 97.4% (SD 0.7%). 
      NLP/ML results had a median positive likelihood ratio of 32.2 (IQR 27.5-39.2) and a 
      median negative likelihood ratio of 0.18 (IQR 0.16-0.20). Performance was better in 
      inpatient-only samples than outpatient-only samples. CONCLUSION: Using NLP and ML 
      techniques, we developed a novel approach to identifying goals-of-care discussions 
      in the EHR. NLP and ML represent a potential approach toward measuring goals-of-care 
      discussions as a research outcome and quality metric.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Manual annotation and categorization of non-standardized 
      text ("free-text") of drug orders entered into electronic health records is a 
      labor-intensive task. However, standardization is required for drug order analyses 
      and has implications for clinical decision support. Machine learning could help to 
      speed up manual labelling efforts. The objective of this study was to analyze the 
      performance of deep machine learning methods to annotate non-standardized text of 
      drug order entries with their therapeutically active ingredients. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The data consisted of drug orders entered 8/2009-4/2014 into the electronic 
      health records of inpatients at a large tertiary care academic medical center. We 
      manually annotated the most frequent order entry patterns with the active ingredient 
      they contain (e.g. "Prograf"⟵"Tacrolimus"). We heuristically included additional 
      orders by means of character sequence comparisons to augment the training dataset. 
      Finally, we trained and employed character-level recurrent deep neural networks to 
      classify non-standardized text of drug order entries according to their active 
      ingredients. RESULTS: A total of 26,611 distinct order patterns were considered in 
      our study, of which the top 7.6% (2028) had been annotated with one of 558 distinct 
      ingredients, leaving 24,583 unlabeled observations. Character-level recurrent deep 
      neural networks achieved a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 98% and outperformed the 
      best representative baseline, a trigram-based Support Vector Machine, by 2 
      percentage points. CONCLUSION: Character-level recurrent deep neural networks can be 
      used to map the active ingredient to non-standardized text of drug order entries, 
      outperforming other representative techniques. While machine learning might help to 
      facilitate categorization tasks, still a considerable amount of manual labelling and 
      reviewing work is required to train such systems.

TI  - Text Processing for Detection of Fungal Ocular Involvement in Critical Care 
      Patients: Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - e18855
LID - 10.2196/18855 [doi]
LID - e18855
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fungal ocular involvement can develop in patients with fungal 
      bloodstream infections and can be vision-threatening. Ocular involvement has become 
      less common in the current era of improved antifungal therapies. Retrospectively 
      determining the prevalence of fungal ocular involvement is important for informing 
      clinical guidelines, such as the need for routine ophthalmologic consultations. 
      However, manual retrospective record review to detect cases is time-consuming. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of fungal ocular involvement 
      in a critical care database using both structured and unstructured electronic health 
      record (EHR) data. METHODS: We queried microbiology data from 46,467 critical care 
      patients over 12 years (2000-2012) from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
      Care III (MIMIC-III) to identify 265 patients with culture-proven fungemia. For each 
      fungemic patient, demographic data, fungal species present in blood culture, and 
      risk factors for fungemia (eg, presence of indwelling catheters, recent major 
      surgery, diabetes, immunosuppressed status) were ascertained. All structured 
      diagnosis codes and free-text narrative notes associated with each patient's 
      hospitalization were also extracted. Screening for fungal endophthalmitis was 
      performed using two approaches: (1) by querying a wide array of eye- and 
      vision-related diagnosis codes, and (2) by utilizing a custom regular expression 
      pipeline to identify and collate relevant text matches pertaining to fungal ocular 
      involvement. Both approaches were validated using manual record review. The main 
      outcome measure was the documentation of any fungal ocular involvement. RESULTS: In 
      total, 265 patients had culture-proven fungemia, with Candida albicans (n=114, 43%) 
      and Candida glabrata (n=74, 28%) being the most common fungal species in blood 
      culture. The in-hospital mortality rate was 121 (46%). In total, 7 patients were 
      identified as having eye- or vision-related diagnosis codes, none of whom had fungal 
      endophthalmitis based on record review. There were 26,830 free-text narrative notes 
      associated with these 265 patients. A regular expression pipeline based on relevant 
      terms yielded possible matches in 683 notes from 108 patients. Subsequent manual 
      record review again demonstrated that no patients had fungal ocular involvement. 
      Therefore, the prevalence of fungal ocular involvement in this cohort was 0%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: MIMIC-III contained no cases of ocular involvement among fungemic 
      patients, consistent with prior studies reporting low rates of ocular involvement in 
      fungemia. This study demonstrates an application of natural language processing to 
      expedite the review of narrative notes. This approach is highly relevant for 
      ophthalmology, where diagnoses are often based on physical examination findings that 
      are documented within clinical notes.

TI  - Assessing Provider-Generated Free-Text Quality in EHR-Integrated Handoff Notes.
PG  - 999-1003
AB  - Handoff notes are increasingly integrated within electronic health record (EHR) 
      systems and often contain data automatically generated from the EHR and free-text 
      narratives. We examined the quality of data entered by providers in the free-text 
      portion of our institutional EHR handoff tool. Overall, 65% of handoff notes 
      contained at least one error (average 1.7 errors per note). Most errors were 
      omissions in information around patient plan/management or assessment/diagnosis 
      rather than entry of false data. Factors associated with increased error rate were 
      increasing hospital day number; weekend note; medical (vs. surgical) service team; 
      and authorship by a medical student, first or fourth year resident physician, or 
      attending physician. Our findings suggest that errors are common in handoff notes, 
      and while these errors are not completely false data, they may provide individuals 
      caring for patients an inaccurate understanding of patient status.

TI  - Automating classification of free-text electronic health records for epidemiological 
      studies.
PG  - 651-8
LID - 10.1002/pds.3205 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Increasingly, patient information is stored in electronic medical records, 
      which could be reused for research. Often these records comprise unstructured 
      narrative data, which are cumbersome to analyze. The authors investigated whether 
      text mining can make these data suitable for epidemiological studies and compared a 
      concept recognition approach and a range of machine learning techniques that require 
      a manually annotated training set. The authors show how this training set can be 
      created with minimal effort by using a broad database query. METHODS: The approaches 
      were tested on two data sets: a publicly available set of English radiology reports 
      for which International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
      Modification code needed to be assigned and a set of Dutch GP records that needed to 
      be classified as either liver disorder cases or noncases. Performance was tested 
      against a manually created gold standard. RESULTS: The best overall performance was 
      achieved by a combination of a manually created filter for removing negations and 
      speculations and rule learning algorithms such as RIPPER, with high scores on both 
      the radiology reports (positive predictive value = 0.88, sensitivity = 0.85, 
      specificity = 1.00) and the GP records (positive predictive value = 0.89, 
      sensitivity =0.91, specificity =0.76). CONCLUSIONS: Although a training set still 
      needs to be created manually, text mining can help reduce the amount of manual work 
      needed to incorporate narrative data in an epidemiological study and will make the 
      data extraction more reproducible. An advantage of machine learning is that it is 
      able to pick up specific language use, such as abbreviations and synonyms used by 
      physicians.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) offer the opportunity to ascertain clinical 
      outcomes at large scale and low cost, thus facilitating cohort studies, quality of 
      care research and clinical trials. For acute myocardial infarction (AMI) the extent 
      to which different EHR sources are accessible and accurate remains uncertain. Using 
      MEDLINE and EMBASE we identified thirty three studies, reporting a total of 128658 
      patients, published between January 2000 and July 2014 that permitted assessment of 
      the validity of AMI diagnosis drawn from EHR sources against a reference such as 
      manual chart review. In contrast to clinical practice, only one study used 
      EHR-derived markers of myocardial necrosis to identify possible AMI cases, none used 
      electrocardiogram findings and one used symptoms in the form of free text combined 
      with coded diagnosis. The remaining studies relied mostly on coded diagnosis. Thirty 
      one studies reported positive predictive value (PPV)≥ 70% between AMI diagnosis from 
      both secondary care and primary care EHRs and the reference. Among fifteen studies 
      reporting EHR-derived AMI phenotypes, three cross-referenced ST-segment elevation 
      AMI diagnosis (PPV range 71-100%), two non-ST-segment elevation AMI (PPV 91.0, 
      92.1%), three non-fatal AMI (PPV range 82-92.2%) and six fatal AMI (PPV range 
      64-91.7%). Clinical coding of EHR-derived AMI diagnosis in primary care and 
      secondary care was found to be accurate in different clinical settings and for 
      different phenotypes. However, markers of myocardial necrosis, ECG and symptoms, the 
      cornerstones of a clinical diagnosis, are underutilised and remain a challenge to 
      retrieve from EHRs.

TI  - Implementing Structured Clinical Templates at a Single Tertiary Hospital: Survey 
      Study.
PG  - e13836
LID - 10.2196/13836 [doi]
LID - e13836
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health record (EHR) systems have been widely adopted in 
      hospitals. However, since current EHRs mainly focus on lowering the number of paper 
      documents used, they have suffered from poor search function and reusability 
      capabilities. To overcome these drawbacks, structured clinical templates have been 
      proposed; however, they are not widely used owing to the inconvenience of data 
      entry. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to verify the usability of structured templates by 
      comparing data entry times. METHODS: A Korean tertiary hospital has implemented 
      structured clinical templates with the modeling of clinical contents for the last 6 
      years. As a result, 1238 clinical content models (ie, body measurements, vital 
      signs, and allergies) have been developed and 492 models for 13 clinical templates, 
      including pathology reports, were applied to EHRs for clinical practice. Then, to 
      verify the usability of the structured templates, data entry times from free-texts 
      and four structured pathology report templates were compared using 4391 entries from 
      structured data entry (SDE) log data and 4265 entries from free-text log data. In 
      addition, a paper-based survey and a focus group interview were conducted with 23 
      participants from three different groups, including EHR developers, pathology 
      transcriptionists, and clinical data extraction team members. RESULTS: Based on the 
      analysis of time required for data entry, in most cases, beginner users of the 
      structured clinical templates required at most 70.18% more time for data entry. 
      However, as users became accustomed to the templates, they were able to enter data 
      more quickly than via free-text entry: at least 1 minute and 23 seconds (16.8%) up 
      to 5 minutes and 42 seconds (27.6%). Interestingly, well-designed thyroid cancer 
      pathology reports required 14.54% less data entry time from the beginning of the SDE 
      implementation. In the interviews and survey, we confirmed that most of the 
      interviewees agreed on the need for structured templates. However, they were 
      skeptical about structuring all the items included in the templates. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The increase in initial elapsed time led users to hold a negative opinion of SDE, 
      despite its benefits. To overcome these obstacles, it is necessary to structure the 
      clinical templates for optimum use. In addition, user experience in terms of ease of 
      data entry must be considered as an essential aspect in the development of 
      structured clinical templates.

TI  - Combining Inpatient and Outpatient Data for Diagnosis of Non-Valvular Atrial 
      Fibrillation Using Electronic Health Records: A Validation Study.
PG  - 477-483
LID - 10.2147/CLEP.S230677 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Previous studies have demonstrated differences in atrial fibrillation (AF) 
      detection based on data from hospital sources without data from outpatient sources. 
      We investigated the detection of documented diagnoses of non-valvular AF in a large 
      Israeli health-care organization using electronic health record data from multiple 
      sources. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an open-chart validation study. Three 
      distinct algorithms for identifying AF in electronic health records, differing in 
      the source of their International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 
      and use of the associated free text, were defined. Algorithm 1 incorporated 
      inpatient data with outpatient data and the associated free text. Algorithm 2 
      incorporated inpatient and outpatient data regardless of the free text associated 
      with AF diagnosis. Algorithm 3 used only inpatient data source. These algorithms 
      were compared to a gold standard and their sensitivity, specificity, positive 
      predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. To 
      establish the gold standard (documentation of arrhythmia based on 
      electrocardiography interpretation or a cardiologist's written diagnosis), 200 
      patients at highest risk for having non-valvular AF were randomly selected for 
      open-chart validation by two physicians. RESULTS: The algorithm that included 
      hospital settings, outpatient settings, and incorporated associated free text in the 
      outpatient records had the optimal balance between all validation measures, with a 
      high level of sensitivity (85.4%), specificity (95.0%), PPV (81.4%), and NPV 
      (96.2%). The alternative algorithm that combined inpatient and outpatient data 
      without free text also performed better than the algorithm that included only 
      hospital data (82.9%, 95.0%, 81.0%, and 95.6%, compared to 70.7%, 96.9%, 85.3%, and 
      92.8%, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV, respectively). CONCLUSION: In this 
      study, involving a comprehensive data collection from inpatient and outpatient 
      sources, incorporating outpatient data with inpatient data improved the diagnosis of 
      non-valvular AF compared to inpatient data alone.

      research: a pilot study in myocardial infarction and death.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Free text in electronic health records (EHR) may contain additional 
      phenotypic information beyond structured (coded) information. For major health 
      events - heart attack and death - there is a lack of studies evaluating the extent 
      to which free text in the primary care record might add information. Our objectives 
      were to describe the contribution of free text in primary care to the recording of 
      information about myocardial infarction (MI), including subtype, left ventricular 
      function, laboratory results and symptoms; and recording of cause of death. We used 
      the CALIBER EHR research platform which contains primary care data from the Clinical 
      Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to hospital admission data, the MINAP 
      registry of acute coronary syndromes and the death registry. In CALIBER we randomly 
      selected 2000 patients with MI and 1800 deaths. We implemented a rule-based natural 
      language engine, the Freetext Matching Algorithm, on site at CPRD to analyse free 
      text in the primary care record without raw data being released to researchers. We 
      analysed text recorded within 90 days before or 90 days after the MI, and on or 
      after the date of death. RESULTS: We extracted 10,927 diagnoses, 3658 test results, 
      3313 statements of negation, and 850 suspected diagnoses from the myocardial 
      infarction patients. Inclusion of free text increased the recorded proportion of 
      patients with chest pain in the week prior to MI from 19 to 27%, and differentiated 
      between MI subtypes in a quarter more patients than structured data alone. Cause of 
      death was incompletely recorded in primary care; in 36% the cause was in coded data 
      and in 21% it was in free text. Only 47% of patients had exactly the same cause of 
      death in primary care and the death registry, but this did not differ between coded 
      and free text causes of death. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who suffer MI or die, 
      unstructured free text in primary care records contains much information that is 
      potentially useful for research such as symptoms, investigation results and specific 
      diagnoses. Access to large scale unstructured data in electronic health records 
      (millions of patients) might yield important insights.

TI  - Text mining occupations from the mental health electronic health record: a natural 
      language processing approach using records from the Clinical Record Interactive 
      Search (CRIS) platform in south London, UK.
PG  - e042274

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We set out to develop, evaluate and implement a novel application using 
      natural language processing to text mine occupations from the free-text of 
      psychiatric clinical notes. DESIGN: Development and validation of a natural language 
      processing application using General Architecture for Text Engineering software to 
      extract occupations from de-identified clinical records. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Electronic health records from a large secondary mental healthcare provider in south 
      London, accessed through the Clinical Record Interactive Search platform. The text 
      mining application was run over the free-text fields in the electronic health 
      records of 341 720 patients (all aged ≥16 years). OUTCOMES: Precision and recall 
      estimates of the application performance; occupation retrieval using the application 
      compared with structured fields; most common patient occupations; and analysis of 
      key sociodemographic and clinical indicators for occupation recording. RESULTS: 
      Using the structured fields alone, only 14% of patients had occupation recorded. By 
      implementing the text mining application in addition to the structured fields, 
      occupations were identified in 57% of patients. The application performed on 
      gold-standard human-annotated clinical text at a precision level of 0.79 and recall 
      level of 0.77. The most common patient occupations recorded were 'student' and 
      'unemployed'. Patients with more service contact were more likely to have an 
      occupation recorded, as were patients of a male gender, older age and those living 
      in areas of lower deprivation. CONCLUSION: This is the first time a natural language 
      processing application has been used to successfully derive patient-level 
      occupations from the free-text of electronic mental health records, performing with 
      good levels of precision and recall, and applied at scale. This may be used to 
      inform clinical studies relating to the broader social determinants of health using 
      electronic health records.

TI  - Temporal information extraction from mental health records to identify duration of 
      untreated psychosis.
PG  - 2

AB  - BACKGROUND: Duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is an important clinical construct 
      in the field of mental health, as longer DUP can be associated with worse 
      intervention outcomes. DUP estimation requires knowledge about when psychosis 
      symptoms first started (symptom onset), and when psychosis treatment was initiated. 
      Electronic health records (EHRs) represent a useful resource for retrospective 
      clinical studies on DUP, but the core information underlying this construct is most 
      likely to lie in free text, meaning it is not readily available for clinical 
      research. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a means to addressing this problem by 
      automatically extracting relevant information in a structured form. As a first step, 
      it is important to identify appropriate documents, i.e., those that are likely to 
      include the information of interest. Next, temporal information extraction methods 
      are needed to identify time references for early psychosis symptoms. This NLP 
      challenge requires solving three different tasks: time expression extraction, 
      symptom extraction, and temporal "linking". In this study, we focus on the first 
      step, using two relevant EHR datasets. RESULTS: We applied a rule-based NLP system 
      for time expression extraction that we had previously adapted to a corpus of mental 
      health EHRs from patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (first referrals). We 
      extended this work by applying this NLP system to a larger set of documents and 
      patients, to identify additional texts that would be relevant for our long-term 
      goal, and developed a new corpus from a subset of these new texts (early 
      intervention services). Furthermore, we added normalized value annotations 
      ("2011-05") to the annotated time expressions ("May 2011") in both corpora. The 
      finalized corpora were used for further NLP development and evaluation, with 
      promising results (normalization accuracy 71-86%). To highlight the specificities of 
      our annotation task, we also applied the final adapted NLP system to a different 
      temporally annotated clinical corpus. CONCLUSIONS: Developing domain-specific 
      methods is crucial to address complex NLP tasks such as symptom onset extraction and 
      retrospective calculation of duration of a preclinical syndrome. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this is the first clinical text resource annotated for temporal entities 
      in the mental health domain.

TI  - Extraction of Geriatric Syndromes From Electronic Health Record Clinical Notes: 
      Assessment of Statistical Natural Language Processing Methods.
PG  - e13039

AB  - BACKGROUND: Geriatric syndromes in older adults are associated with adverse 
      outcomes. However, despite being reported in clinical notes, these syndromes are 
      often poorly captured by diagnostic codes in the structured fields of electronic 
      health records (EHRs) or administrative records. OBJECTIVE: We aim to automatically 
      determine if a patient has any geriatric syndromes by mining the free text of 
      associated EHR clinical notes. We assessed which statistical natural language 
      processing (NLP) techniques are most effective. METHODS: We applied conditional 
      random fields (CRFs), a widely used machine learning algorithm, to identify each of 
      10 geriatric syndrome constructs in a clinical note. We assessed three sets of 
      features and attributes for CRF operations: a base set, enhanced token, and 
      contextual features. We trained the CRF on 3901 manually annotated notes from 85 
      patients, tuned the CRF on a validation set of 50 patients, and evaluated it on 50 
      held-out test patients. These notes were from a group of US Medicare patients over 
      65 years of age enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Health Maintenance Organization and 
      cared for by a large group practice in Massachusetts. RESULTS: A final feature set 
      was formed through comprehensive feature ablation experiments. The final CRF model 
      performed well at patient-level determination (macroaverage F1=0.834, microaverage 
      F1=0.851); however, performance varied by construct. For example, at phrase-partial 
      evaluation, the CRF model worked well on constructs such as absence of fecal control 
      (F1=0.857) and vision impairment (F1=0.798) but poorly on malnutrition (F1=0.155), 
      weight loss (F1=0.394), and severe urinary control issues (F1=0.532). Errors were 
      primarily due to previously unobserved words (ie, out-of-vocabulary) and a lack of 
      context. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that statistical NLP can be used to identify 
      geriatric syndromes from EHR-extracted clinical notes. This creates new 
      opportunities to identify patients with geriatric syndromes and study their health 
      outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Delirium is an acute confusional state, associated with morbidity and 
      mortality in diverse medically ill populations. Delirium is preventable and 
      treatable when diagnosed but the diagnosis is often missed. This important and 
      difficult diagnosis is an attractive candidate for computer-aided decision support 
      if it can be reliably identified at scale. OBJECTIVE: Here, using an electronic 
      health record-based case definition of delirium, we characterize incidence of this 
      highly morbid condition in 2 large academic medical centers. METHODS: Using the 
      electronic health record of 2 large New England academic medical centers, we 
      calculated and compared the rate of the diagnosis of delirium using a range of 
      administrative and discharge summary text-based case definitions over an 8-year 
      period. RESULTS: Depending on case definitions, the overall delirium rate ranged 
      from 2.0-5.4% of 809,512 admissions identified. The identified rate of delirium 
      increased between 2005 and 2013, such that by the final year of the study, one of 
      the two sites reported delirium in 7.0% of cases. The concordance between case 
      definitions was low; only half of the cases identified by text analysis were 
      captured by administrative data. CONCLUSION: Delirium may be better captured by 
      composite outcomes, including both administrative claims data and elements drawn 
      from unstructured data sources. That the rate of delirium observed in this study is 
      far lower than the current literature estimates suggests that further work on case 
      definitions, identification, and documented diagnosis is required.

TI  - Measuring Adoption of Patient Priorities-Aligned Care Using Natural Language 
      Processing of Electronic Health Records: Development and Validation of the Model.
PG  - e18756
LID - 10.2196/18756 [doi]
LID - e18756
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient Priorities Care (PPC) is a model of care that aligns health care 
      recommendations with priorities of older adults who have multiple chronic 
      conditions. Following identification of patient priorities, this information is 
      documented in the patient's electronic health record (EHR). OBJECTIVE: Our goal is 
      to develop and validate a natural language processing (NLP) model that reliably 
      documents when clinicians identify patient priorities (ie, values, outcome goals, 
      and care preferences) within the EHR as a measure of PPC adoption. METHODS: This is 
      a retrospective analysis of unstructured National Veteran Health Administration EHR 
      free-text notes using an NLP model. The data were sourced from 778 patient notes of 
      658 patients from encounters with 144 social workers in the primary care setting. 
      Each patient's free-text clinical note was reviewed by 2 independent reviewers for 
      the presence of PPC language such as priorities, values, and goals. We developed an 
      NLP model that utilized statistical machine learning approaches. The performance of 
      the NLP model in training and validation with 10-fold cross-validation is reported 
      via accuracy, recall, and precision in comparison to the chart review. RESULTS: Of 
      778 notes, 589 (75.7%) were identified as containing PPC language (kappa=0.82, 
      P<.001). The NLP model in the training stage had an accuracy of 0.98 (95% CI 
      0.98-0.99), a recall of 0.98 (95% CI 0.98-0.99), and precision of 0.98 (95% CI 
      0.97-1.00). The NLP model in the validation stage had an accuracy of 0.92 (95% CI 
      0.90-0.94), recall of 0.84 (95% CI 0.79-0.89), and precision of 0.84 (95% CI 
      0.77-0.91). In contrast, an approach using simple search terms for PPC only had a 
      precision of 0.757. CONCLUSIONS: An automated NLP model can reliably measure with 
      high precision, recall, and accuracy when clinicians document patient priorities as 
      a key step in the adoption of PPC.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) have the potential to improve health-care quality 
      by allowing providers to make better decisions at the point of care based on 
      electronically aggregated data and by facilitating clinical research. These goals 
      are easier to achieve when key, disease-specific clinical information is documented 
      as structured data elements (SDEs) that computers can understand and process, rather 
      than as free-text/natural-language narrative. This article reviews the benefits of 
      capturing disease-specific SDEs. It highlights several design and implementation 
      considerations, including the impact on efficiency and expressivity of clinical 
      documentation and the importance of adhering to data standards when available. 
      Pulmonary disease-specific examples of collection instruments are provided from two 
      commonly used commercial EHRs. Future developments that can leverage SDEs to improve 
      clinical quality and research are discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous biomedical studies identified many lifestyle exposures that 
      could possibly represent risk factors for dementia in general or dementia due to 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). These lifestyle exposures are mainly mentioned in 
      free-text electronic health records (EHRs). However, automatic extraction and 
      assessment of these exposures using EHRs remains understudied. METHODS: A natural 
      language processing (NLP) approach was adopted to extract lifestyle exposures and 
      intervention strategies from the clinical notes of 260 patients with clinical 
      diagnoses of AD dementia and 260 age-matched cognitively unimpaired persons. 
      Statistics of lifestyle exposures were compared between these two groups. The 
      mapping results of the NLP extraction were evaluated by comparing the results with 
      data captured independently by clinicians. RESULTS: Thirty out of fifty-five 
      potentially relevant lifestyle exposures were mentioned in our clinical note 
      dataset. Twenty-two dietary factors and three substance abuses that were potentially 
      relevant were not found in clinical notes. Patients with AD dementia were 
      significantly exposed to more of the potential risk factors compared to the 
      cognitively unimpaired subjects (χ2 = 120.31, p-value < 0.001). The average accuracy 
      of the automated extraction was 74.0% in comparison with the manual review of 
      randomly selected 50 sample documents. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We illustrated the 
      feasibility of NLP techniques for the automated evaluation of a large number 
      lifestyle habits using free-text EHR data. We found that AD dementia patients were 
      exposed to more of the potential risk factors than the comparison group. Our results 
      also demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of investigating putative risk 
      factors using NLP techniques.

TI  - Natural language processing and the oncologic history: is there a match?
PG  - e15-9

AB  - PURPOSE: The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) is creating 
      rich databases documenting the cancer patient's care continuum. However, much of 
      this data, especially narrative "oncologic histories," are "locked" within free text 
      (unstructured) portions of notes. Nationwide incentives, ranging from certification 
      (Quality Oncology Practice Initiative) to monetary reimbursement (the Health 
      Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act), increasingly require 
      the translation of these histories into treatment summaries for patient use and into 
      tools to assist in transitions of care. Unfortunately, formulation of treatment 
      summaries from these data is difficult and time-consuming. The rapidly developing 
      field of automated natural language processing may offer a solution to this 
      communication problem. METHODS: We surveyed a cross section of providers at Beth 
      Israel Deaconess Medical Center regarding the importance of treatment summaries and 
      whether these were being formulated on a regular basis. We also developed a program 
      for the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside challenge, which was 
      designed to extract meaningful information from EHRs. The program was then applied 
      to a sample of narrative oncologic histories. RESULTS: The majority of providers 
      (86%) felt that treatment summaries were important, but only 11% actually 
      implemented them. The most common obstacles identified were lack of time and lack of 
      EHR tools. We demonstrated that relevant medical concepts can be automatically 
      extracted from oncologic histories with reasonable accuracy and precision. 
      CONCLUSION: Natural language processing technology offers a promising method for 
      structuring a free-text oncologic history into a compact treatment summary, creating 
      a robust and accurate means of communication between providers and between provider 
      and patient.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich documentation regarding disease 
      symptoms and progression, but EHR data is challenging to use for diagnosis 
      prediction due to its high dimensionality, relative scarcity, and substantial level 
      of noise. We investigated how to best represent EHR data for predicting cervical 
      cancer, a serious disease where early detection is beneficial for the outcome of 
      treatment. A case group of 1321 patients with cervical cancer were matched to ten 
      times as many controls, and for both groups several types of events were extracted 
      from their EHRs. These events included clinical codes, lab results, and contents of 
      free text notes retrieved using a LSTM neural network. Clinical events are described 
      with great variation in EHR texts, leading to a very large feature space. Therefore, 
      an event hierarchy inferred from the textual events was created to represent the 
      clinical texts. Overall, the events extracted from free text notes contributed the 
      most to the final prediction, and the hierarchy of textual events further improved 
      performance. Four classifiers were evaluated for predicting a future cancer 
      diagnosis where Random Forest achieved the best results with an AUC of 0.70 from a 
      year before diagnosis up to 0.97 one day before diagnosis. We conclude that our 
      approach is sound and had excellent discrimination at diagnosis, but only modest 
      discrimination capacity before this point. Since our study objective was earlier 
      disease prediction than such, we propose further work should consider extending 
      patient histories through e.g. the integration of primary health records preceding 
      referral to hospital.

PG  - 93-97
LID - 10.3233/SHTI200129 [doi]
AB  - Electronic health records contain valuable information on patients' clinical history 
      in the form of free text. Manually analyzing millions of these documents is 
      unfeasible and automatic natural language processing methods are essential for 
      efficiently exploiting these data. Within this, normalization of clinical entities, 
      where the aim is to link entity mentions to reference vocabularies, is of utmost 
      importance to successfully extract knowledge from clinical narratives. In this paper 
      we present sieve-based models combined with heuristics and word embeddings and 
      present results of our participation in the 2019 n2c2 (National NLP Clinical 
      Challenges) shared-task on clinical concept normalization.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI190255 [doi]
AB  - For patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, determining symptom onset is crucial 
      for timely and successful intervention. In mental health records, information about 
      early symptoms is often documented only in free text, and thus needs to be extracted 
      to support clinical research. To achieve this, natural language processing (NLP) 
      methods can be used. Development and evaluation of NLP systems requires manually 
      annotated corpora. We present a corpus of mental health records annotated with 
      temporal relations for psychosis symptoms. We propose a methodology for document 
      selection and manual annotation to detect symptom onset information, and develop an 
      annotated corpus. To assess the utility of the created corpus, we propose a pilot 
      NLP system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first temporally-annotated 
      corpus tailored to a specific clinical use-case.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Trauma injury severity scores are currently calculated retrospectively 
      from the electronic health record (EHR) using manual annotation by certified trauma 
      coders. Natural language processing (NLP) of clinical documents in the EHR may 
      enable automated injury scoring. We hypothesize that NLP with machine learning can 
      discriminate between cases of severe and non-severe injury to the thorax after 
      trauma. METHODS: Clinical documents from a trauma center were examined between 2014 
      and 2018. Severe chest injury was defined as a thorax abbreviated injury score (AIS) 
      >2 and served as the reference standard for supervised learning. Free text unigrams 
      and concept unique identifiers (CUIs) from the Unified Medical Language Systems 
      (UMLS) were extracted from clinical documents collected at one hour, four hours, and 
      eight hours after patient arrival to the emergency department. Logistic regression 
      models with elastic net regularization were tuned to maximize area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) using 10-fold cross-validation on 
      the training dataset (80%) and tested on a hold-out 20% dataset. RESULTS: There were 
      6,891 traumas that met inclusion criteria. The complete data corpus consisted of 
      473,694 documents. Models trained using the first hour of data had a mean AUROC of 
      0.88 (95%CI [0.86, 0.89]); model discrimination and reclassification from the first 
      hour significantly improved after eight hours with a mean AUROC of 0.94 (95%CI 
      [0.93, 0.95]). Performance of models using CUIs were similar to unigrams (p>0.05). 
      Models demonstrated excellent clinical face validity. CONCLUSIONS: Both CUIs and 
      unigrams demonstrated excellent discrimination in predicting severity of chest 
      injury using the first eight hours of clinical documents. Our model demonstrates 
      that automated anatomical injury scoring is feasible and may be used for aggregation 
      of data for trauma research and quality programs.

AB  - The digitalization of health and medicine and the growing availability of electronic 
      health records (EHRs) has encouraged healthcare professionals and clinical 
      researchers to adopt cutting-edge methodologies in the realms of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) and big data analytics to exploit existing large medical 
      databases. In Hospital and Health System pharmacies, the application of natural 
      language processing (NLP) and machine learning to access and analyze the 
      unstructured, free-text information captured in millions of EHRs (e.g., medication 
      safety, patients' medication history, adverse drug reactions, interactions, 
      medication errors, therapeutic outcomes, and pharmacokinetic consultations) may 
      become an essential tool to improve patient care and perform real-time evaluations 
      of the efficacy, safety, and comparative effectiveness of available drugs. This 
      approach has an enormous potential to support share-risk agreements and guide 
      decision-making in pharmacy and therapeutics (P&T) Committees.

LID - 10.1093/jamiaopen/ooz016 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To create test collections for evaluating clinical information retrieval 
      (IR) systems and advancing clinical IR research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic 
      health record (EHR) data, including structured and free-text data, from 45 000 
      patients who are a part of the Mayo Clinic Biobank cohort was retrieved from the 
      clinical data warehouse. The clinical IR system indexed a total of 42 million 
      free-text EHR documents. The search queries consisted of 56 topics developed through 
      a collaboration between Mayo Clinic and Oregon Health & Science University. We 
      described the creation of test collections, including a to-be-evaluated document 
      pool using five retrieval models, and human assessment guidelines. We analyzed the 
      relevance judgment results in terms of human agreement and time spent, and results 
      of three levels of relevance, and reported performance of five retrieval models. 
      RESULTS: The two judges had a moderate overall agreement with a Kappa value of 0.49, 
      spent a consistent amount of time judging the relevance, and were able to identify 
      easy and difficult topics. The conventional retrieval model performed best on most 
      topics while a concept-based retrieval model had better performance on the topics 
      requiring conceptual level retrieval. DISCUSSION: IR can provide an alternate 
      approach to leveraging clinical narratives for patient information discovery as it 
      is less dependent on semantics. Our study showed the feasibility of test collections 
      along with a few challenges. CONCLUSION: The conventional test collections for 
      evaluating the IR system show potential for successfully evaluating clinical IR 
      systems with a few challenges to be investigated.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe and appraise contrast agent allergy documentation in the 
      electronic health record (EHR). METHODS: We systematically identified medical 
      imaging drugs and class terms in an integrated EHR allergy repository for patients 
      seen at a large health care system between 2000 and 2013. Structured and free-text 
      contrast allergy records were normalized and categorized by inciting agent and 
      nature of adverse reaction. Allergen records were evaluated by their level of 
      specificity. Reaction records were evaluated by whether the reaction was known or 
      unknown and whether known reactions would be categorized as allergic-like or 
      physiologic. RESULTS: Among 2.7 million patients, we identified 36,144 patients 
      (1.3%) with at least one of 40,669 contrast allergy records associated with 49,000 
      reactions. Contrast allergens were more likely than other allergens to be entered as 
      free text (15.2% versus 6.3%; odds ratio 2.69, 95% confidence interval 2.61-2.76). 
      There were 1,305 unique contrast allergen records, which we grouped into 141 
      concepts. Most contrast allergen records were ambiguous contrast concepts (69.1%), 
      rather than imaging modality-specific class terms (19.4%) or specific contrast 
      agents (11.5%). Contrast reactions were occasionally entered as free text (24.8%), 
      which together with structured entries were grouped into 183 concepts. A known 
      reaction was documented in 71.8% of cases; however, 12.2% were non-allergic-like 
      reactions. CONCLUSION: Contrast allergy records in EHRs are diverse and commonly low 
      quality. Continued EHR enhancements and training are needed to support contrast 
      allergy documentation to facilitate improved patient care and medical research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A significant amount of clinical information captured as free-text 
      narratives could be better used for several applications, such as clinical decision 
      support, ontology development, evidence-based practice, and research. The Human 
      Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is specifically used for semantic comparisons for 
      diagnostic purposes. All these functions require quality coverage of the domain of 
      interest. The authors used natural language processing to capture craniofacial and 
      oral phenotype signatures from electronic health records and then used these 
      signatures for evaluation of existing oral phenotype ontology coverage. METHODS: The 
      authors applied a text-processing pipeline based on the clinical Text Analysis and 
      Knowledge Extraction System to annotate the clinical notes with Unified Medical 
      Language System codes. The authors extracted the disease or disorder phenotype 
      terms, which were then compared with HPO terms and their synonyms. RESULTS: The 
      authors retrieved 2,153 deidentified clinical notes from 558 patients. Finally, 
      2,416 unique diseases or disorders phenotype terms were extracted, which included 
      210 craniofacial or oral phenotype terms. Twenty-six of these phenotypes were not 
      found in the HPO. CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrated that natural language 
      processing tools could extract relevant phenotype terms from clinical narratives, 
      which could help identify gaps in existing ontologies and enhance craniofacial and 
      dental phenotyping vocabularies. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The expansion of terms in 
      the dental, oral, and craniofacial domains in the HPO is particularly important as 
      the dental community moves toward electronic health records.

PG  - 441-6
AB  - A natural language challenge devised by Informatics for Integrating Biology and the 
      Bedside (i2b2) was to analyze free-text health data to construct a multi-class, 
      multi-label classification system focused on obesity and its co-morbidities. This 
      report presents a case study in which a natural language processing (NLP) toolkit, 
      called NLTK, was used in the challenge. This report provides a brief review of NLP 
      in the context of EHR applications, briefly surveys and contrasts some existing NLP 
      toolkits, and reports on our experiences with the i2b2 case study. Our efforts 
      uncovered issues including the lack of human annotated physician notes for use as 
      NLP training data, differences between conventional free-text and medical notes, and 
      potential hardware and software limitations affecting future projects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Instruments rating risk of harm to self and others are widely used in 
      inpatient forensic psychiatry settings. A potential alternate or supplementary means 
      of risk prediction is from the automated analysis of case notes in Electronic Health 
      Records (EHRs) using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This exploratory study rated 
      presence or absence and frequency of words in a forensic EHR dataset, comparing four 
      reference dictionaries. Seven machine learning algorithms and different time periods 
      of EHR analysis were used to probe which dictionary and which time period were most 
      predictive of risk assessment scores on validated instruments. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The EHR dataset comprised de-identified forensic inpatient notes from the 
      Wilfred Lopes Centre in Tasmania. The data comprised unstructured free-text case 
      note entries and serial ratings of three risk assessment scales: Historical Clinical 
      Risk Management-20 (HCR-20), Short-Term Assessment of Risk and Treatability (START) 
      and Dynamic Appraisal of Situational Aggression (DASA). Four NLP dictionary word 
      lists were selected: 6865 mental health symptom words from the Unified Medical 
      Language System (UMLS), 455 DSM-IV diagnoses from UMLS repository, 6790 English 
      positive and negative sentiment words, and 1837 high frequency words from the Corpus 
      of Contemporary American English (COCA). Seven machine learning methods Bagging, 
      J48, Jrip, Logistic Model Trees (LMT), Logistic Regression, Linear Regression and 
      Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used to identify the combination of dictionaries 
      and algorithms that best predicted risk assessment scores. RESULTS: The most 
      accurate prediction was attained on the DASA dataset using the sentiment dictionary 
      and the LMT and SVM algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: NLP, used in conjunction with NLP 
      dictionaries and machine learning, predicted risk ratings on the HCR-20, START, and 
      DASA, based on EHR content. Further research is required to ascertain the utility of 
      NLP approaches in predicting endpoints of actual self-harm, harm to others or 
      victimisation.

      Answering.
PG  - 626-635
AB  - This paper describes a paraphrasing approach to improve the performance of question 
      answering (QA) for electronic health records (EHRs). QA systems for structured EHR 
      data usually rely on semantic parsing, which aims to generate machine-understandable 
      logical forms from free-text questions. Training semantic parsers requires large 
      datasets of question-logical form (QL) pairs, which are labor-intensive to create. 
      Considering the scarcity of large QL datasets in the clinical domain, we propose a 
      framework for expanding an existing dataset using paraphrasing. We experiment with 
      different heuristics for multiple sample sizes and iterations to assess the effect 
      of adding paraphrasing to the task of semantic parsing. We found that adding 
      paraphrases to an existing dataset based on TERTHRESHOLD scores results in an 
      improved performance in the majority (74%) of the experimental runs. Hence, the 
      proposed paraphrasing-based framework has the potential to improve the performance 
      of QA systems using a limited set of existing QL annotations.

TI  - Statistical inference for natural language processing algorithms with a 
      demonstration using type 2 diabetes prediction from electronic health record notes.
PG  - 1089-1100
LID - 10.1111/biom.13338 [doi]
AB  - The pointwise mutual information statistic (PMI), which measures how often two words 
      occur together in a document corpus, is a cornerstone of recently proposed popular 
      natural language processing algorithms such as word2vec. PMI and word2vec reveal 
      semantic relationships between words and can be helpful in a range of applications 
      such as document indexing, topic analysis, or document categorization. We use 
      probability theory to demonstrate the relationship between PMI and word2vec. We use 
      the theoretical results to demonstrate how the PMI can be modeled and estimated in a 
      simple and straight forward manner. We further describe how one can obtain standard 
      error estimates that account for within-patient clustering that arises from patterns 
      of repeated words within a patient's health record due to a unique health history. 
      We then demonstrate the usefulness of PMI on the problem of predictive 
      identification of disease from free text notes of electronic health records. 
      Specifically, we use our methods to distinguish those with and without type 2 
      diabetes mellitus in electronic health record free text data using over 400 000 
      clinical notes from an academic medical center.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Comprehensive analysis of ophthalmic surgical outcomes is often 
      restricted by limited methodologies for efficiently and accurately extracting 
      clinical information from electronic health record (EHR) systems because much is in 
      free-text form. This study aims to utilize advanced methods to automate extraction 
      of clinical concepts from the EHR free text to study visual acuity (VA), intraocular 
      pressure (IOP), and medication outcomes of cataract and glaucoma surgeries. METHODS: 
      Patients who underwent cataract or glaucoma surgery at an academic medical center 
      between 2009 and 2018 were identified by Current Procedural Terminology codes. 
      Rule-based algorithms were developed and used on EHR clinical narrative text to 
      extract intraocular lens (IOL) power and implant type, as well as to create a 
      surgery laterality classifier. MedEx (version 1.3.7) was used on free-text clinical 
      notes to extract information on eye medications and compared to information from 
      medication orders. Random samples of free-text notes were reviewed by two 
      independent masked annotators to assess inter-annotator agreement on outcome 
      variable classification and accuracy of classifiers. VA and IOP were available from 
      semi-structured fields. RESULTS: This study cohort included 6347 unique patients, 
      with 8550 stand-alone cataract surgeries, 451 combined cataract/glaucoma surgeries, 
      and 961 glaucoma surgeries without concurrent cataract surgery. The rule-based 
      laterality classifier achieved 100% accuracy compared to manual review of a sample 
      of operative notes by independent masked annotators. For cataract surgery alone, 
      glaucoma surgery alone, or combined cataract/glaucoma surgeries, our automated 
      extraction algorithm achieved 99-100% accuracy compared to manual annotation of 
      samples of notes from each group, including IOL model and IOL power for cataract 
      surgeries, and glaucoma implant for glaucoma surgeries. For glaucoma medications, 
      there was 90.7% inter-annotator agreement. After adjudication, 85.0% of medications 
      identified by MedEx determined to be correct. Determination of surgical laterality 
      enabled evaluation of pre- and postoperative VA and IOP for operative eyes. 
      CONCLUSION: This text-processing pipeline can accurately capture surgical laterality 
      and implant model usage from free-text operative notes of cataract and glaucoma 
      surgeries, enabling extraction of clinical outcomes including visual acuities, 
      intraocular pressure, and medications from the EHR system. Use of this approach with 
      EHRs to assess ophthalmic surgical outcomes can benefit research groups interested 
      in studying the safety and clinical efficacies of different surgical approaches.

TI  - The Development of the Military Service Identification Tool: Identifying Military 
      Veterans in a Clinical Research Database Using Natural Language Processing and 
      Machine Learning.
PG  - e15852
LID - 10.2196/15852 [doi]
LID - e15852
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health care records (EHRs) are a rich source of 
      health-related information, with potential for secondary research use. In the United 
      Kingdom, there is no national marker for identifying those who have previously 
      served in the Armed Forces, making analysis of the health and well-being of veterans 
      using EHRs difficult. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a tool to identify 
      veterans from free-text clinical documents recorded in a psychiatric EHR database. 
      METHODS: Veterans were manually identified using the South London and Maudsley 
      (SLaM) Biomedical Research Centre Clinical Record Interactive Search-a database 
      holding secondary mental health care electronic records for the SLaM National Health 
      Service Foundation Trust. An iterative approach was taken; first, a structured query 
      language (SQL) method was developed, which was then refined using natural language 
      processing and machine learning to create the Military Service Identification Tool 
      (MSIT) to identify if a patient was a civilian or veteran. Performance, defined as 
      correct classification of veterans compared with incorrect classification, was 
      measured using positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, F1 
      score, and accuracy (otherwise termed Youden Index). RESULTS: A gold standard 
      dataset of 6672 free-text clinical documents was manually annotated by human coders. 
      Of these documents, 66.00% (4470/6672) were then used to train the SQL and MSIT 
      approaches and 34.00% (2202/6672) were used for testing the approaches. To develop 
      the MSIT, an iterative 2-stage approach was undertaken. In the first stage, an SQL 
      method was developed to identify veterans using a keyword rule-based approach. This 
      approach obtained an accuracy of 0.93 in correctly predicting civilians and 
      veterans, a positive predictive value of 0.81, a sensitivity of 0.75, and a negative 
      predictive value of 0.95. This method informed the second stage, which was the 
      development of the MSIT using machine learning, which, when tested, obtained an 
      accuracy of 0.97, a positive predictive value of 0.90, a sensitivity of 0.91, and a 
      negative predictive value of 0.98. CONCLUSIONS: The MSIT has the potential to be 
      used in identifying veterans in the United Kingdom from free-text clinical 
      documents, providing new and unique insights into the health and well-being of this 
      population and their use of mental health care services.

TI  - Benefits and risks of structuring and/or coding the presenting patient history in 
      the electronic health record: systematic review.
PG  - 337-46
LID - 10.1136/bmjqs-2011-000450 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient histories in electronic health records currently exist mainly in 
      free text format thereby limiting the possibility that decision support technology 
      may contribute to the accuracy and timeliness of clinical diagnoses. Structuring 
      and/or coding make patient histories potentially computable. METHODS: A systematic 
      review was undertaken of the benefits and risks of structuring and/or coding patient 
      history by searching nine international databases for published and unpublished 
      studies over the period 1990-2010. The focus was on the current patient history, 
      defined as information reported by a patient or the patient's caregiver about the 
      patient's present health situation and health status. Findings were synthesised 
      through a theoretically based textural analysis. FINDINGS: Of the 9207 potentially 
      eligible papers identified, 10 studies satisfied the eligibility criteria. There was 
      evidence of a modest number of benefits associated with structuring the current 
      patient history, including obtaining more complete clinical histories, improved 
      accuracy of patient self-documented histories, and better associated decision-making 
      by professionals. However, no studies demonstrated any resulting improvements in 
      patient care or outcomes. When more detailed records were obtained through the use 
      of a structured format no attempt was made to confirm if this additional information 
      was clinically useful. No studies investigated possible risks associated with 
      structuring the patient history. No studies examined coding of the patient history. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There is an insufficient evidence base for sound policy making on the 
      benefits and risks of structuring and/or coding patient history. The authors suggest 
      this field of enquiry warrants further investigation given the interest in use of 
      decision support technology to aid diagnoses.

TI  - Factors Influencing Problem List Use in Electronic Health Records-Application of the 
      Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology.
PG  - 415-426
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1712466 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Problem-oriented electronic health record (EHR) systems can help 
      physicians to track a patient's status and progress, and organize clinical 
      documentation, which could help improving quality of clinical data and enable data 
      reuse. The problem list is central in a problem-oriented medical record. However, 
      current problem lists remain incomplete because of the lack of end-user training and 
      inaccurate content of underlying terminologies. This leads to modifications of 
      diagnosis code descriptions and use of free-text notes, limiting reuse of data. 
      OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate factors that influence acceptance and actual use 
      of the problem list, and used these to propose recommendations, to increase the 
      value of problem lists for (re)use. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were 
      conducted with physicians, heads of medical departments, and data quality experts, 
      who were invited through snowball sampling. The interviews were transcribed and 
      coded. Comments were fitted in constructs of the validated framework unified theory 
      of acceptance user technology (UTAUT), and were discussed in terms of facilitators 
      and barriers. RESULTS: In total, 24 interviews were conducted. We found large 
      variability in attitudes toward problem list use. Barriers included uncertainty 
      about the responsibility for maintaining the problem list and little perceived 
      benefits. Facilitators included the (re)design of policies, improved (peer-to-peer) 
      training to increase motivation, and positive peer feedback and monitoring. 
      Motivation is best increased through sharing benefits relevant in the care process, 
      such as providing overview, timely generation of discharge or referral letters, and 
      reuse of data. Furthermore, content of the underlying terminology should be improved 
      and the problem list should be better presented in the EHR system. CONCLUSION: To 
      let physicians accept and use the problem list, policies and guidelines should be 
      redesigned, and prioritized by supervising staff. Additionally, peer-to-peer 
      training on the benefits of using the problem list is needed.

TI  - Early temporal characteristics of elderly patient cognitive impairment in electronic 
      health records.
PG  - 149
LID - 10.1186/s12911-019-0858-0 [doi]
LID - 149
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aging population has led to an increase in cognitive impairment (CI) 
      resulting in significant costs to patients, their families, and society. A research 
      endeavor on a large cohort to better understand the frequency and severity of CI is 
      urgent to respond to the health needs of this population. However, little is known 
      about temporal trends of patient health functions (i.e., activity of daily living 
      [ADL]) and how these trends are associated with the onset of CI in elderly patients. 
      Also, the use of a rich source of clinical free text in electronic health records 
      (EHRs) to facilitate CI research has not been well explored. The aim of this study 
      is to characterize and better understand early signals of elderly patient CI by 
      examining temporal trends of patient ADL and analyzing topics of patient medical 
      conditions in clinical free text using topic models. METHODS: The study cohort 
      consists of physician-diagnosed CI patients (n = 1,435) and cognitively unimpaired 
      (CU) patients (n = 1,435) matched by age and sex, selected from patients 65 years of 
      age or older at the time of enrollment in the Mayo Clinic Biobank. A corpus analysis 
      was performed to examine the basic statistics of event types and practice settings 
      where the physician first diagnosed CI. We analyzed the distribution of ADL in three 
      different age groups over time before the development of CI. Furthermore, we applied 
      three different topic modeling approaches on clinical free text to examine how 
      patients' medical conditions change over time when they were close to CI diagnosis. 
      RESULTS: The trajectories of ADL deterioration became steeper in CI patients than CU 
      patients approximately 1 to 1.5 year(s) before the actual physician diagnosis of CI. 
      The topic modeling showed that the topic terms were mostly correlated and captured 
      the underlying semantics relevant to CI when approaching to CI diagnosis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There exist notable differences in temporal trends of basic and 
      instrumental ADL between CI and CU patients. The trajectories of certain individual 
      ADL, such as bathing and responsibility of own medication, were closely associated 
      with CI development. The topic terms obtained by topic modeling methods from 
      clinical free text have a potential to show how CI patients' conditions evolve and 
      reveal overlooked conditions when they close to CI diagnosis.

PG  - 5562-5
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347254 [doi]
AB  - Electronic Health Records (EHR) contain large amounts of useful information that 
      could potentially be used for building models for predicting onset of diseases. In 
      this study, we have investigated the use of free-text and coded data in Marshfield 
      Clinic's EHR, individually and in combination for building machine learning based 
      models to predict the first ever episode of atrial fibrillation and/or atrial 
      flutter (AFF). We trained and evaluated our AFF models on the EHR data across 
      different time intervals (1, 3, 5 and all years) prior to first documented onset of 
      AFF. We applied several machine learning methods, including naïve bayes, support 
      vector machines (SVM), logistic regression and random forests for building AFF 
      prediction models and evaluated these using 10-fold cross-validation approach. On 
      text-based datasets, the best model achieved an F-measure of 60.1%, when applied 
      exclusively to coded data. The combination of textual and coded data achieved 
      comparable performance. The study results attest to the relative merit of utilizing 
      textual data to complement the use of coded data for disease onset prediction 
      modeling.

TI  - Validating free-text order entry for a note-centric EHR.
PG  - 1103-10
AB  - Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have increased the utility and portability of 
      health information by storing it in structured formats. However, EHRs separate this 
      structured data from the rich, free-text descriptions of clinical notes. The 
      ultimate objective of our research is to develop an interactive progress note that 
      unifies entry, access, and retrieval of structured and unstructured health 
      information. In this study we present the design and subsequent testing with eight 
      clinicians of a core element of this envisioned note: free-text order entry. 
      Clinicians saw this new order-entry paradigm as a way to save time and preserve data 
      quality by reducing double-documentation. However, they wanted the prototype to 
      recognize more diverse types of shorthand and apply default values to fields that 
      remain fairly constant across orders, such as number of refills and pickup location. 
      Future work will test more complex orders, such as cascading orders, with a broader 
      range of clinicians.

PG  - e1002823

LID - e1002823
AB  - The combination of improved genomic analysis methods, decreasing genotyping costs, 
      and increasing computing resources has led to an explosion of clinical genomic 
      knowledge in the last decade. Similarly, healthcare systems are increasingly 
      adopting robust electronic health record (EHR) systems that not only can improve 
      health care, but also contain a vast repository of disease and treatment data that 
      could be mined for genomic research. Indeed, institutions are creating EHR-linked 
      DNA biobanks to enable genomic and pharmacogenomic research, using EHR data for 
      phenotypic information. However, EHRs are designed primarily for clinical care, not 
      research, so reuse of clinical EHR data for research purposes can be challenging. 
      Difficulties in use of EHR data include: data availability, missing data, incorrect 
      data, and vast quantities of unstructured narrative text data. Structured 
      information includes billing codes, most laboratory reports, and other variables 
      such as physiologic measurements and demographic information. Significant 
      information, however, remains locked within EHR narrative text documents, including 
      clinical notes and certain categories of test results, such as pathology and 
      radiology reports. For relatively rare observations, combinations of simple 
      free-text searches and billing codes may prove adequate when followed by manual 
      chart review. However, to extract the large cohorts necessary for genome-wide 
      association studies, natural language processing methods to process narrative text 
      data may be needed. Combinations of structured and unstructured textual data can be 
      mined to generate high-validity collections of cases and controls for a given 
      condition. Once high-quality cases and controls are identified, EHR-derived cases 
      can be used for genomic discovery and validation. Since EHR data includes a broad 
      sampling of clinically-relevant phenotypic information, it may enable multiple 
      genomic investigations upon a single set of genotyped individuals. This chapter 
      reviews several examples of phenotype extraction and their application to genetic 
      research, demonstrating a viable future for genomic discovery using EHR-linked data.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Postoperative delirium is a common complication after major surgery 
      among the elderly. Despite its potentially serious consequences, the complication 
      often goes undetected and undiagnosed. In order to provide diagnosis support one 
      could potentially exploit the information hidden in free text documents from 
      electronic health records using data-driven clinical decision support tools. 
      However, these tools depend on labeled training data and can be both time consuming 
      and expensive to create. METHODS: The recent learning with anchors framework 
      resolves this problem by transforming key observations (anchors) into labels. This 
      is a promising framework, but it is heavily reliant on clinicians knowledge for 
      specifying good anchor choices in order to perform well. In this paper we propose a 
      novel method for specifying anchors from free text documents, following an 
      exploratory data analysis approach based on clustering and data visualization 
      techniques. We investigate the use of the new framework as a way to detect 
      postoperative delirium. RESULTS: By applying the proposed method to medical data 
      gathered from a Norwegian university hospital, we increase the area under the 
      precision-recall curve from 0.51 to 0.96 compared to baselines. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      proposed approach can be used as a framework for clinical decision support for 
      postoperative delirium.

AB  - CONTEXT: Adverse events in healthcare are often collated in incident reports which 
      contain unstructured free text. Learning from these events may improve patient 
      safety. Natural language processing (NLP) uses computational techniques to 
      interrogate free text, reducing the human workload associated with its analysis. 
      There is growing interest in applying NLP to patient safety, but the evidence in the 
      field has not been summarised and evaluated to date. OBJECTIVE: To perform a 
      systematic literature review and narrative synthesis to describe and evaluate NLP 
      methods for classification of incident reports and adverse events in healthcare. 
      METHODS: Data sources included Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, CINAHL, 
      MIDIRS, ISI Web of Science, SciELO, Google Scholar, PROSPERO, hand searching of key 
      articles, and OpenGrey. Data items were manually abstracted to a standardised 
      extraction form. RESULTS: From 428 articles screened for eligibility, 35 met the 
      inclusion criteria of using NLP to perform a classification task on incident 
      reports, or with the aim of detecting adverse events. The majority of studies used 
      free text from incident reporting systems or electronic health records. Models were 
      typically designed to classify by type of incident, type of medication error, or 
      harm severity. A broad range of NLP techniques are demonstrated to perform these 
      classification tasks with favourable performance outcomes. There are methodological 
      challenges in how these results can be interpreted in a broader context. CONCLUSION: 
      NLP can generate meaningful information from unstructured data in the specific 
      domain of the classification of incident reports and adverse events. Understanding 
      what or why incidents are occurring is important in adverse event analysis. If NLP 
      enables these insights to be drawn from larger datasets it may improve the learning 
      from adverse events in healthcare.

TI  - Applying a natural language processing tool to electronic health records to assess 
      performance on colonoscopy quality measures.
PG  - 1233-9.e14

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastroenterology specialty societies have advocated that providers 
      routinely assess their performance on colonoscopy quality measures. Such routine 
      measurement has been hampered by the costs and time required to manually review 
      colonoscopy and pathology reports. Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of 
      computer science in which programs are trained to extract relevant information from 
      text reports in an automated fashion. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the efficiency and 
      potential of NLP-based colonoscopy quality measurement. DESIGN: In a cross-sectional 
      study design, we used a previously validated NLP program to analyze colonoscopy 
      reports and associated pathology notes. The resulting data were used to generate 
      provider performance on colonoscopy quality measures. SETTING: Nine hospitals in the 
      University of Pittsburgh Medical Center health care system. PATIENTS: Study sample 
      consisted of the 24,157 colonoscopy reports and associated pathology reports from 
      2008 to 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Provider performance on 7 quality measures. 
      RESULTS: Performance on the colonoscopy quality measures was generally poor, and 
      there was a wide range of performance. For example, across hospitals, the adequacy 
      of preparation was noted overall in only 45.7% of procedures (range 14.6%-86.1% 
      across 9 hospitals), cecal landmarks were documented in 62.7% of procedures (range 
      11.6%-90.0%), and the adenoma detection rate was 25.2% (range 14.9%-33.9%). 
      LIMITATIONS: Our quality assessment was limited to a single health care system in 
      western Pennsylvania. CONCLUSIONS: Our study illustrates how NLP can mine free-text 
      data in electronic records to measure and report on the quality of care. Even within 
      a single academic hospital system, there is considerable variation in the 
      performance on colonoscopy quality measures, demonstrating the need for better 
      methods to regularly and efficiently assess quality.

AB  - Electronic health record systems are ubiquitous and the majority of patients' data 
      are now being collected electronically in the form of free text. Deep learning has 
      significantly advanced the field of natural language processing and the 
      self-supervised representation learning and the transfer learning have become the 
      methods of choice in particular when the high quality annotated data are limited. 
      Identification of medical concepts and information extraction is a challenging task, 
      yet important ingredient for parsing unstructured data into structured and tabulated 
      format for downstream analytical tasks. In this work we introduced a named-entity 
      recognition (NER) model for clinical natural language processing. The model is 
      trained to recognise seven categories: drug names, route of administration, 
      frequency, dosage, strength, form, duration. The model was first pre-trained on the 
      task of predicting the next word, using a collection of 2 million free-text 
      patients' records from MIMIC-III corpora followed by fine-tuning on the named-entity 
      recognition task. The model achieved a micro-averaged F1 score of 0.957 across all 
      seven categories. Additionally, we evaluated the transferability of the developed 
      model using the data from the Intensive Care Unit in the US to secondary care mental 
      health records (CRIS) in the UK. A direct application of the trained NER model to 
      CRIS data resulted in reduced performance of F1 = 0.762, however after fine-tuning 
      on a small sample from CRIS, the model achieved a reasonable performance of 
      F1 = 0.944. This demonstrated that despite a close similarity between the data sets 
      and the NER tasks, it is essential to fine-tune the target domain data in order to 
      achieve more accurate results. The resulting model and the pre-trained embeddings 
      are available at https://github.com/kormilitzin/med7.

TI  - Detecting unplanned care from clinician notes in electronic health records.
PG  - e313-9
LID - 10.1200/JOP.2014.002741 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Reduction in unplanned episodes of care, such as emergency department 
      visits and unplanned hospitalizations, are important quality outcome measures. 
      However, many events are only documented in free-text clinician notes and are labor 
      intensive to detect by manual medical record review. METHODS: We studied 308,096 
      free-text machine-readable documents linked to individual entries in our electronic 
      health records, representing care for patients with breast, GI, or thoracic cancer, 
      whose treatment was initiated at one academic medical center, Stanford Health Care 
      (SHC). Using a clinical text-mining tool, we detected unplanned episodes documented 
      in clinician notes (for non-SHC visits) or in coded encounter data for SHC-delivered 
      care and the most frequent symptoms documented in emergency department (ED) notes. 
      RESULTS: Combined reporting increased the identification of patients with one or 
      more unplanned care visits by 32% (15% using coded data; 20% using all the data) 
      among patients with 3 months of follow-up and by 21% (23% using coded data; 28% 
      using all the data) among those with 1 year of follow-up. Based on the textual 
      analysis of SHC ED notes, pain (75%), followed by nausea (54%), vomiting (47%), 
      infection (36%), fever (28%), and anemia (27%), were the most frequent symptoms 
      mentioned. Pain, nausea, and vomiting co-occur in 35% of all ED encounter notes. 
      CONCLUSION: The text-mining methods we describe can be applied to automatically 
      review free-text clinician notes to detect unplanned episodes of care mentioned in 
      these notes. These methods have broad application for quality improvement efforts in 
      which events of interest occur outside of a network that allows for patient data 
      sharing.

AB  - With an aging patient population and increasing complexity in patient disease 
      trajectories, physicians are often met with complex patient histories from which 
      clinical decisions must be made. Due to the increasing rate of adverse events and 
      hospitals facing financial penalties for readmission, there has never been a greater 
      need to enforce evidence-led medical decision-making using available health care 
      data. In the present work, we studied a cohort of 7,741 patients, of whom 4,080 were 
      diagnosed with cancer, surgically treated at a University Hospital in the years 
      2004-2012. We have developed a methodology that allows disease trajectories of the 
      cancer patients to be estimated from free text in electronic health records (EHRs). 
      By using these disease trajectories, we predict 80% of patient events ahead in time. 
      By control of confounders from 8326 quantified events, we identified 557 events that 
      constitute high subsequent risks (risk > 20%), including six events for cancer and 
      seven events for metastasis. We believe that the presented methodology and findings 
      could be used to improve clinical decision support and personalize trajectories, 
      thereby decreasing adverse events and optimizing cancer treatment.

TI  - Using Artificial Intelligence With Natural Language Processing to Combine Electronic 
      Health Record's Structured and Free Text Data to Identify Nonvalvular Atrial 
      Fibrillation to Decrease Strokes and Death: Evaluation and Case-Control Study.
PG  - e28946
LID - 10.2196/28946 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) affects almost 6 million 
      Americans and is a major contributor to stroke but is significantly undiagnosed and 
      undertreated despite explicit guidelines for oral anticoagulation. OBJECTIVE: The 
      aim of this study is to investigate whether the use of semisupervised natural 
      language processing (NLP) of electronic health record's (EHR) free-text information 
      combined with structured EHR data improves NVAF discovery and treatment and perhaps 
      offers a method to prevent thousands of deaths and save billions of dollars. 
      METHODS: We abstracted 96,681 participants from the University of Buffalo faculty 
      practice's EHR. NLP was used to index the notes and compare the ability to identify 
      NVAF, congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, 
      stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65 to 74 years, sex 
      category (CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc), and Hypertension, Abnormal liver/renal function, Stroke 
      history, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile INR, Elderly, Drug/alcohol usage 
      (HAS-BLED) scores using unstructured data (International Classification of Diseases 
      codes) versus structured and unstructured data from clinical notes. In addition, we 
      analyzed data from 63,296,120 participants in the Optum and Truven databases to 
      determine the NVAF frequency, rates of CHA(2)DS(2)‑VASc ≥2, and no contraindications 
      to oral anticoagulants, rates of stroke and death in the untreated population, and 
      first year's costs after stroke. RESULTS: The structured-plus-unstructured method 
      would have identified 3,976,056 additional true NVAF cases (P<.001) and improved 
      sensitivity for CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc and HAS-BLED scores compared with the structured 
      data alone (P=.002 and P<.001, respectively), causing a 32.1% improvement. For the 
      United States, this method would prevent an estimated 176,537 strokes, save 10,575 
      lives, and save >US $13.5 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence-informed 
      bio-surveillance combining NLP of free-text information with structured EHR data 
      improves data completeness, prevents thousands of strokes, and saves lives and 
      funds. This method is applicable to many disorders with profound public health 
      consequences.

TI  - Extracting diagnoses and investigation results from unstructured text in electronic 
      health records by semi-supervised machine learning.
PG  - e30412
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0030412 [doi]
LID - e30412
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records are invaluable for medical research, but much 
      of the information is recorded as unstructured free text which is time-consuming to 
      review manually. AIM: To develop an algorithm to identify relevant free texts 
      automatically based on labelled examples. METHODS: We developed a novel machine 
      learning algorithm, the 'Semi-supervised Set Covering Machine' (S3CM), and tested 
      its ability to detect the presence of coronary angiogram results and ovarian cancer 
      diagnoses in free text in the General Practice Research Database. For training the 
      algorithm, we used texts classified as positive and negative according to their 
      associated Read diagnostic codes, rather than by manual annotation. We evaluated the 
      precision (positive predictive value) and recall (sensitivity) of S3CM in 
      classifying unlabelled texts against the gold standard of manual review. We compared 
      the performance of S3CM with the Transductive Vector Support Machine (TVSM), the 
      original fully-supervised Set Covering Machine (SCM) and our 'Freetext Matching 
      Algorithm' natural language processor. RESULTS: Only 60% of texts with Read codes 
      for angiogram actually contained angiogram results. However, the S3CM algorithm 
      achieved 87% recall with 64% precision on detecting coronary angiogram results, 
      outperforming the fully-supervised SCM (recall 78%, precision 60%) and TSVM (recall 
      2%, precision 3%). For ovarian cancer diagnoses, S3CM had higher recall than the 
      other algorithms tested (86%). The Freetext Matching Algorithm had better precision 
      than S3CM (85% versus 74%) but lower recall (62%). CONCLUSIONS: Our novel S3CM 
      machine learning algorithm effectively detected free texts in primary care records 
      associated with angiogram results and ovarian cancer diagnoses, after training on 
      pre-classified test sets. It should be easy to adapt to other disease areas as it 
      does not rely on linguistic rules, but needs further testing in other electronic 
      health record datasets.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop scalable natural language processing (NLP) infrastructure for 
      processing the free text in electronic health records (EHRs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      We extend the open-source Apache cTAKES NLP software with several standard 
      technologies for scalability. We remove processing bottlenecks by monitoring 
      component queue size. We process EHR free text for patients in the PrecisionLink 
      Biobank at Boston Children's Hospital. The extracted concepts are made searchable 
      via a web-based portal. RESULTS: We processed over 1.2 million notes for over 8000 
      patients, extracting 154 million concepts. Our largest tested configuration 
      processes over 1 million notes per day. DISCUSSION: The unique information 
      represented by extracted NLP concepts has great potential to provide a more complete 
      picture of patient status. CONCLUSION: NLP large EHR document collections can be 
      done efficiently, in service of high throughput phenotyping.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With higher adoption of electronic health records at health-care 
      centers, electronic search algorithms (computable phenotype) for identifying acute 
      decompensated heart failure (ADHF) among hospitalized patients can be an invaluable 
      tool to enhance data abstraction accuracy and efficacy in order to improve clinical 
      research accrual and patient centered outcomes. We aimed to derive and validate a 
      computable phenotype for ADHF in hospitalized patients. METHODS: We screened 256, 
      443 eligible (age > 18 years and with prior research authorization) individuals who 
      were admitted to Mayo Clinic Hospital in Rochester, MN, from January 1, 2006, 
      through December 31, 2014. Using a randomly selected derivation cohort of 938 
      patients, several iterations of a free-text electronic search were developed and 
      refined. The computable phenotype was subsequently validated in an independent 
      cohort 100 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the computable phenotype 
      were compared to the gold standard (expert review of charts) and International 
      Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) codes for Acute Heart Failure. RESULTS: In the 
      derivation cohort, the computable phenotype achieved a sensitivity of 97.5%, and 
      specificity of 100%, whereas ICD-9 codes for Acute Heart Failure achieved a 
      sensitivity of 47.5% and specificity of 96.7%. When all Heart Failure codes (ICD-9) 
      were used, sensitivity and specificity were 97.5 and 86.6%, respectively. In the 
      validation cohort, the sensitivity and specificity of the computable phenotype were 
      100 and 98.5%. The sensitivity and specificity for the ICD-9 codes (Acute Heart 
      Failure) were 42 and 98.5%. Upon use of all Heart Failure codes (ICD-9), sensitivity 
      and specificity were 96.8 and 91.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that using 
      computable phenotype to ascertain ADHF from the clinical notes contained within the 
      electronic medical record are feasible and reliable. Our computable phenotype 
      outperformed ICD-9 codes for the detection of ADHF.

      Language Processing Analysis.
PG  - e24020
LID - 10.2196/24020 [doi]
LID - e24020
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of many genetic disorders and 
      familial diseases significantly improve if the family history (FH) of a patient is 
      known. Such information is often written in the free text of clinical notes. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop automated methods that enable access 
      to FH data through natural language processing. METHODS: We performed information 
      extraction by using transformers to extract disease mentions from notes. We also 
      experimented with rule-based methods for extracting family member (FM) information 
      from text and coreference resolution techniques. We evaluated different transfer 
      learning strategies to improve the annotation of diseases. We provided a thorough 
      error analysis of the contributing factors that affect such information extraction 
      systems. RESULTS: Our experiments showed that the combination of domain-adaptive 
      pretraining and intermediate-task pretraining achieved an F1 score of 81.63% for the 
      extraction of diseases and FMs from notes when it was tested on a public shared task 
      data set from the National Natural Language Processing Clinical Challenges (N2C2), 
      providing a statistically significant improvement over the baseline (P<.001). In 
      comparison, in the 2019 N2C2/Open Health Natural Language Processing Shared Task, 
      the median F1 score of all 17 participating teams was 76.59%. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      approach, which leverages a state-of-the-art named entity recognition model for 
      disease mention detection coupled with a hybrid method for FM mention detection, 
      achieved an effectiveness that was close to that of the top 3 systems participating 
      in the 2019 N2C2 FH extraction challenge, with only the top system convincingly 
      outperforming our approach in terms of precision.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare data from electronic health records (EHRs) and related health 
      information technology (IT) tools are critical data sources for pragmatic clinical 
      trials and observational studies aimed at producing real-world evidence. To unlock 
      the full potential of such data to advance science, the data must be complete and in 
      structured formats to facilitate research use. METHODS: A Health IT survey was 
      conducted within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) to 
      explore information related to data completeness and presence of unstructured data 
      (e.g., clinical notes, free text) for conducting the EHR-based research for 
      substance use disorders (SUDs). The analysis was based on 36 participants from 36 
      facilities located in 14 states and affiliated with the CTN. RESULTS: The mean age 
      of the participants (n = 34) was 48.0 years (SD = 9.8). Of the participants 
      enrolled, 50.0% were female and 82.4% were white. Participants' facilities were from 
      four census-defined regions (South 35.3%, Northeast 29.4%, West 20.6%, Midwest 
      11.8%, Missing 2.9%) and represented diverse settings. The EHR was used by all 
      surveyed facilities including 17 different kinds of EHR platforms or vendors, and 
      17.6% (n = 6) of surveyed facilities also used a separate EHR for behavioral health 
      care (e.g., SUD care). Paper records were also used by 76.5% of surveyed facilities 
      for clinical care (e.g., for health risk appraisal questionnaires, substance use 
      screening or assessment, check-in screening, substance use specific 
      intervention/treatment or referral, or labs/testing). The prevalence of using a 
      patient portal, practice management system, and mHealth for patient care was 76.5%, 
      50.0%, and 29.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: While results are descriptive in nature, 
      they reveal the heterogeneity in the existing EHRs and frequent use of paper records 
      to document patient care tasks, especially for SUD care. The use of a separate EHR 
      for behavioral healthcare also suggests the challenge of obtaining complete EHR data 
      to support research for SUDs. Much EHR development, integration, and standardization 
      needs to be done especially in regard to SUD treatment to facilitate research across 
      disparate healthcare systems.

      practice-based evidence of the performance of coronary stents.
PG  - e0182889

LID - e0182889
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using 
      drug-eluting stents (DES) is an indispensable treatment for coronary artery disease. 
      However, to evaluate the performance of various types of stents for PCI, numerous 
      resources are required. We extracted clinical information from free-text records 
      and, using practice-based evidence, compared the efficacy of various DES. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: We developed a text mining tool based on regular expression and applied 
      it to PCI reports stored in the electronic health records (EHRs) of Ajou University 
      Hospital from 2010-2014. The PCI data were extracted from EHRs with a sensitivity of 
      0.996, a specificity of 1.000, and an F-measure of 0.995 when compared with a sample 
      of 200 reports. Using these data, we compared the performance of stents by 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox hazard proportional regression. RESULTS: In the 
      self-validation analysis comparing the first-generation to the second-generation 
      DES, the second-generation DES was superior to the first-generation DES (hazard 
      ratio [HR]: 0.423, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.284-0.630) in terms of target 
      vessel revascularization (TVR), showing similar findings to the established results 
      of previous studies. Among the second-generation DES, the biodegradable-polymer DES 
      tended to be superior, with a risk of TVR (HR: 0.568, 95% CI: 0.281-1.147) falling 
      below than that for the durable-polymer DES approximately 1 year after the index 
      procedure. The Endeavor stent had the highest TVR risk among the newer generation 
      DES (HR: 2.576, 95% CI: 1.273-5.210). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated 
      how to construct a PCI data warehouse of PCI-related parameters obtained from 
      free-text electronic records with high accuracy for use in the post surveillance of 
      coronary stents in a time- and cost effective manner. Post surveillance of the 
      practice based evidence in the PCI data warehouse indicated that the 
      biodegradable-polymer DES might have a lower risk of TVR than the durable-polymer 
      DES.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the impacts that structuring of electronic health records (EHRs) 
      has had from the perspective of secondary use of patient data as reflected in 
      currently published literature. This paper presents the results of a systematic 
      literature review aimed at answering the following questions; (1) what are the 
      common methods of structuring patient data to serve secondary use purposes; (2) what 
      are the common methods of evaluating patient data structuring in the secondary use 
      context, and (3) what impacts or outcomes of EHR structuring have been reported from 
      the secondary use perspective. METHODS: The reported study forms part of a wider 
      systematic literature review on the impacts of EHR structuring methods and 
      evaluations of their impact. The review was based on a 12-step systematic review 
      protocol adapted from the Cochrane methodology. Original articles included in the 
      study were divided into three groups for analysis and reporting based on their use 
      focus: nursing documentation, medical use and secondary use (presented in this 
      paper). The analysis from the perspective of secondary use of data includes 85 
      original articles from 1975 to 2010 retrieved from 15 bibliographic databases. 
      RESULTS: The implementation of structured EHRs can be roughly divided into 
      applications for documenting patient data at the point of care and application for 
      retrieval of patient data (post hoc structuring). Two thirds of the secondary use 
      articles concern EHR structuring methods which were still under development or in 
      the testing phase. METHODS: of structuring patient data such as codes, 
      terminologies, reference information models, forms or templates and documentation 
      standards were usually applied in combination. Most of the identified benefits of 
      utilizing structured EHR data for secondary use purposes concentrated on information 
      content and quality or on technical quality and reliability, particularly in the 
      case of Natural Language Processing (NLP) studies. A few individual articles 
      evaluated impacts on care processes, productivity and costs, patient safety, care 
      quality or other health impacts. In most articles these endpoints were usually 
      discussed as goals of secondary use and less as evidence-supported impacts, 
      resulting from the use of structured EHR data for secondary purposes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Further studies and more sound evaluation methods are needed for evidence on how 
      EHRs are utilized for secondary purposes, and how structured documentation methods 
      can serve different users' needs, e.g. administration, statistics and research and 
      development, in parallel to medical use purposes.

      De-Identification Tools.
PG  - 241-250
AB  - A growing quantity of health data is being stored in Electronic Health Records 
      (EHR). The free-text section of these clinical notes contains important patient and 
      treatment information for research but also contains Personally Identifiable 
      Information (PII), which cannot be freely shared within the research community 
      without compromising patient confidentiality and privacy rights. Significant work 
      has been invested in investigating automated approaches to text de-identification, 
      the process of removing or redacting PII. Few studies have examined the performance 
      of existing de-identification pipelines in a controlled comparative analysis. In 
      this study, we use publicly available corpora to analyze speed and accuracy 
      differences between three de-identification systems that can be run off-the-shelf: 
      Amazon Comprehend Medical PHId, Clinacuity's CliniDeID, and the National Library of 
      Medicine's Scrubber. No single system dominated all the compared metrics. NLM 
      Scrubber was the fastest while CliniDeID generally had the highest accuracy.

TI  - 'Real time' monitoring of antipsychotic prescribing in patients with dementia: a 
      study using the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) platform to enhance safer 
      prescribing.
LID - 10.1136/bmjoq-2019-000778 [doi]
LID - e000778
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of antipsychotic drugs in dementia has been reported to be 
      associated with increased risk of cerebrovascular events and mortality. There is an 
      international drive to reduce the use of these agents in patients with dementia and 
      to improve the safety of prescribing and monitoring in this area. OBJECTIVES: The 
      aim of this project was to use enhanced automated regular feedback of information 
      from electronic health records to improve the quality of antipsychotic prescribing 
      and monitoring in people with dementia. METHODS: The South London and Maudsley NHS 
      Foundation Trust (SLaM) incorporated antipsychotic monitoring forms into its 
      electronic health records. The SLaM Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) 
      platform provides researcher access to de-identified health records, and natural 
      language processing is used in CRIS to derive structured data from unstructured free 
      text, including recorded diagnoses and medication. Algorithms were thus developed to 
      ascertain patients with dementia receiving antipsychotic treatment and to determine 
      whether monitoring forms had been completed. We used two improvement 
      plan-do-study-act cycles to improve the accuracy of the algorithm for automated 
      evaluation and provided monthly feedback on team performance. RESULTS: A steady 
      increase in antipsychotic monitoring form completion was observed across the study 
      period. The percentage of our sample with a completed antipsychotic monitoring form 
      more than doubled from October 2017 (22%) to January 2019 (58%). CONCLUSION: 'Real 
      time' monitoring and regular feedback to teams offer a time-effective approach, 
      complementary to standard audit methods, to enhance the safer prescribing of high 
      risk drugs.

TI  - Using machine learning to identify health outcomes from electronic health record 
      data.
PG  - 331-342
LID - 10.1007/s40471-018-0165-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain valuable data for 
      identifying health outcomes, but these data also present numerous challenges when 
      creating computable phenotyping algorithms. Machine learning methods could help with 
      some of these challenges. In this review, we discuss four common scenarios that 
      researchers may find helpful for thinking critically about when and for what tasks 
      machine learning may be used to identify health outcomes from EHR data. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: We first consider the conditions in which machine learning may be 
      especially useful with respect to two dimensions of a health outcome: 1) the 
      characteristics of its diagnostic criteria, and 2) the format in which its 
      diagnostic data are usually stored within EHR systems. In the first dimension, we 
      propose that for health outcomes with diagnostic criteria involving many clinical 
      factors, vague definitions, or subjective interpretations, machine learning may be 
      useful for modeling the complex diagnostic decision-making process from a vector of 
      clinical inputs to identify individuals with the health outcome. In the second 
      dimension, we propose that for health outcomes where diagnostic information is 
      largely stored in unstructured formats such as free text or images, machine learning 
      may be useful for extracting and structuring this information as part of a natural 
      language processing system or an image recognition task. We then consider these two 
      dimensions jointly to define four common scenarios of health outcomes. For each 
      scenario, we discuss the potential uses for machine learning - first assuming 
      accurate and complete EHR data and then relaxing these assumptions to accommodate 
      the limitations of real-world EHR systems. We illustrate these four scenarios using 
      concrete examples and describe how recent studies have used machine learning to 
      identify these health outcomes from EHR data. SUMMARY: Machine learning has great 
      potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of health outcome identification 
      from EHR systems, especially under certain conditions. To promote the use of machine 
      learning in EHR-based phenotyping tasks, future work should prioritize efforts to 
      increase the transportability of machine learning algorithms for use in multi-site 
      settings.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are heterogeneous. With 
      availability of therapeutic classes with distinct immunologic mechanisms of action, 
      it has become imperative to identify markers that predict likelihood of response to 
      each drug class. However, robust development of such tools has been challenging 
      because of need for large prospective cohorts with systematic and careful assessment 
      of treatment response using validated indices. Most hospitals in the United States 
      use electronic health records (EHRs) that warehouse a large amount of narrative 
      (free-text) and codified (administrative) data generated during routine clinical 
      care. These data have been used to construct virtual disease cohorts for 
      epidemiologic research as well as for defining genetic basis of disease states or 
      discrete laboratory values.(1-3) Whether EHR-based data can be used to validate 
      genetic associations for more nuanced outcomes such as treatment response has not 
      been examined previously.

      such as patient ID, patient name, e-mail and phone number. These data are fairly 
      easy to de-identify, that is, replace with other identifiers. However, these data 
      also occur in fields with doctors' free-text notes written in an abbreviated style 
      that cannot be analyzed grammatically. If we replace a word that looks like a name, 
      but isn't, we degrade readability and medical correctness. If we fail to replace it 
      when we should, we degrade confidentiality. We de-identified an existing Danish 
      electronic health record database, ending up with 323,122 patient health records. We 
      had to invent many methods for de-identifying potential identifiers in the free-text 
      notes. The de-identified health records should be used with caution for statistical 
      purposes because we removed health records that were so special that they couldn't 
      be de-identified. Furthermore, we distorted geography by replacing zip codes with 
      random zip codes.

TI  - COVID-19 SignSym: A fast adaptation of general clinical NLP tools to identify and 
      normalize COVID-19 signs and symptoms to OMOP common data model.
LID - arXiv:2007.10286v3
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world rapidly infecting millions of people. 
      An efficient tool that can accurately recognize important clinical concepts of 
      COVID-19 from free text in electronic health records will be significantly valuable 
      to accelerate various applications of COVID-19 research. To this end, the existing 
      clinical NLP tool CLAMP was quickly adapted to COVID-19 information and generated an 
      automated tool called COVID-19 SignSym, which can extract and signs/symptoms and 
      their eight attributes such as temporal information and negations from clinical 
      text. The extracted information is also mapped to standard clinical concepts in the 
      common data model of OHDSI OMOP. Evaluation on clinical notes and medical dialogues 
      demonstrated promising results. It is freely accessible to the community as a 
      downloadable package of APIs (https://clamp.uth.edu/covid/nlp.php). We believe 
      COVID-19 SignSym will provide fundamental supports to the secondary use of EHRs, 
      thus accelerating the global research of COVID-19.

TI  - A dynamic reaction picklist for improving allergy reaction documentation in the 
      electronic health record.
PG  - 917-923
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa042 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Incomplete and static reaction picklists in the allergy module led to 
      free-text and missing entries that inhibit the clinical decision support intended to 
      prevent adverse drug reactions. We developed a novel, data-driven, "dynamic" 
      reaction picklist to improve allergy documentation in the electronic health record 
      (EHR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We split 3 decades of allergy entries in the EHR of a 
      large Massachusetts healthcare system into development and validation datasets. We 
      consolidated duplicate allergens and those with the same ingredients or allergen 
      groups. We created a reaction value set via expert review of a previously developed 
      value set and then applied natural language processing to reconcile reactions from 
      structured and free-text entries. Three association rule-mining measures were used 
      to develop a comprehensive reaction picklist dynamically ranked by allergen. The 
      dynamic picklist was assessed using recall at top k suggested reactions, comparing 
      performance to the static picklist. RESULTS: The modified reaction value set 
      contained 490 reaction concepts. Among 4 234 327 allergy entries collected, 7463 
      unique consolidated allergens and 469 unique reactions were identified. Of the 3 
      dynamic reaction picklists developed, the 1 with the optimal ranking achieved 
      recalls of 0.632, 0.763, and 0.822 at the top 5, 10, and 15, respectively, 
      significantly outperforming the static reaction picklist ranked by reaction 
      frequency. CONCLUSION: The dynamic reaction picklist developed using EHR data and a 
      statistical measure was superior to the static picklist and suggested proper 
      reactions for allergy documentation. Further studies might evaluate the usability 
      and impact on allergy documentation in the EHR.

TI  - Natural language processing for prediction of readmission in posterior lumbar fusion 
      patients: which free-text notes have the most utility?
LID - S1529-9430(21)00852-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.spinee.2021.08.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The increasing volume of free-text notes available in electronic 
      health records has created an opportunity for natural language processing (NLP) 
      algorithms to mine this unstructured data in order to detect and predict adverse 
      outcomes. Given the volume and diversity of documentation available in spine 
      surgery, it remains unclear which types of documentation offer the greatest value 
      for prediction of adverse outcomes. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective review of 
      medical records at two academic and three community hospitals. PURPOSE: The purpose 
      of this study was to conduct an exploratory analysis in order to examine the utility 
      of free-text notes generated during the index hospitalization for lumbar spine 
      fusion for prediction of 90-day unplanned readmission. PATIENT SAMPLE: Adult 
      patients 18 years or older undergoing lumbar spine fusion for lumbar 
      spondylolisthesis or lumbar spinal stenosis between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 
      2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was inpatient admission within 90-days 
      of discharge from the index hospitalization. METHODS: The predictive performance of 
      NLP algorithms developed by using discharge summary notes, operative notes, nursing 
      notes, physical therapy notes, case management notes, medical doctor (MD) (resident 
      or attending), and allied practice professional (APP) (nurse practitioner or 
      physician assistant) notes were assessed by discrimination, calibration, overall 
      performance. RESULTS: Overall, 708 patients were included in the study and 83 
      (11.7%) had 90-day inpatient readmission. In the independent testing set of patients 
      (n=141) not used for model development, the area under the receiver operating curve 
      of NLP algorithms for prediction of 90-day readmission using discharge summary 
      notes, operative notes, nursing notes, physical therapy notes, case management 
      notes, MD/APP notes was 0.70, 0.57, 0.57, 0.60, 0.60, and 0.49 respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: In this exploratory analysis, discharge summary, physical therapy, and 
      case management notes had the most utility and daily MD/APP progress notes had the 
      least utility for prediction of 90-day inpatient readmission in lumbar fusion 
      patients among the free-text documentation generated during the index 
      hospitalization.

AB  - As the complexity of biomedical data increases, so do the opportunities to leverage 
      them to advance science and clinical care. Electronic health records form a rich but 
      complex source of large amounts of data gathered during routine clinical care. 
      Through the use of codified and free-text concepts identified using clinical 
      informatics tools such as natural language processing, disease phenotyping can be 
      performed with a high degree of accuracy. Technologies such as genome sequencing, 
      gene expression profiling, proteomic and metabolomic analyses, and electronic 
      devices and wearables are generating large amounts of data from various populations, 
      cell types, and disorders (big data). However, to make these data useable for the 
      next step of biomarker discovery, precision medicine, and clinical practice, it is 
      imperative to harmonize and integrate these diverse data sources. In this article, 
      we introduce important building blocks for precision medicine, including common data 
      models, text mining and natural language processing, privacy-preserved record 
      linkage, machine learning for predictive modeling, and health information exchange.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS) is a devastating form of acute kidney injury 
      (AKI) in advanced liver disease patients with high morbidity and mortality, but 
      phenotyping algorithms have not yet been developed using large electronic health 
      record (EHR) databases. We evaluated and compared multiple phenotyping methods to 
      achieve an accurate algorithm for HRS identification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      national retrospective cohort of patients with cirrhosis and AKI admitted to 124 
      Veterans Affairs hospitals was assembled from electronic health record data 
      collected from 2005 to 2013. AKI was defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global 
      Outcomes criteria. Five hundred and four hospitalizations were selected for manual 
      chart review and served as the gold standard. Electronic Health Record based 
      predictors were identified using structured and free text clinical data, subjected 
      through NLP from the clinical Text Analysis Knowledge Extraction System. We explored 
      several dimension reduction techniques for the NLP data, including newer 
      high-throughput phenotyping and word embedding methods, and ascertained their 
      effectiveness in identifying the phenotype without structured predictor variables. 
      With the combined structured and NLP variables, we analyzed five phenotyping 
      algorithms: penalized logistic regression, naïve Bayes, support vector machines, 
      random forest, and gradient boosting. Calibration and discrimination metrics were 
      calculated using 100 bootstrap iterations. In the final model, we report odds ratios 
      and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUC) for the different models ranged from 0.73 to 0.93; with 
      penalized logistic regression having the best discriminatory performance. 
      Calibration for logistic regression was modest, but gradient boosting and support 
      vector machines were superior. NLP identified 6985 variables; a priori variable 
      selection performed similarly to dimensionality reduction using high-throughput 
      phenotyping and semantic similarity informed clustering (AUC of 0.81 - 0.82). 
      CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated improved phenotyping of a challenging AKI 
      etiology, HRS, over ICD-9 coding. We also compared performance among multiple 
      approaches to EHR-derived phenotyping, and found similar results between methods. 
      Lastly, we showed that automated NLP dimension reduction is viable for acute 
      illness.

TI  - Investigating Bullying as a Predictor of Suicidality in a Clinical Sample of 
      Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
PG  - 988-997
LID - 10.1002/aur.2292 [doi]
AB  - For typically developing adolescents, being bullied is associated with increased 
      risk of suicidality. Although adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at 
      increased risk of both bullying and suicidality, there is very little research that 
      examines the extent to which an experience of being bullied may increase suicidality 
      within this specific population. To address this, we conducted a retrospective 
      cohort study to investigate the longitudinal association between experiencing 
      bullying and suicidality in a clinical population of 680 adolescents with ASD. 
      Electronic health records of adolescents (13-17 years), using mental health services 
      in South London, with a diagnosis of ASD were analyzed. Natural language processing 
      was employed to identify mentions of bullying and suicidality in the free text 
      fields of adolescents' clinical records. Cox regression analysis was employed to 
      investigate the longitudinal relationship between bullying and suicidality outcomes. 
      Reported experience of bullying in the first month of clinical contact was 
      associated with an increased risk suicidality over the follow-up period (hazard 
      ratio = 1.82; 95% confidence interval = 1.28-2.59). In addition, female gender, 
      psychosis, affective disorder diagnoses, and higher intellectual ability were all 
      associated with suicidality at follow-up. This study is the first to demonstrate the 
      strength of longitudinal associations between bullying and suicidality in a clinical 
      population of adolescents with ASD, using automated approaches to detect key life 
      events within clinical records. Our findings provide support for identifying and 
      dealing with bullying in schools, and for antibullying strategy's incorporation into 
      wider suicide prevention programs for young people with ASD. Autism Res 2020, 13: 
      988-997. © 2020 The Authors. Autism Research published by International Society for 
      Autism Research published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: We investigated 
      the relationship between bullying and suicidality in young people with autism 
      spectrum disorder (ASD). We examined the clinical records of adolescents (aged 
      13-18 years old) with ASD in South London who were receiving treatment from Child 
      and Adolescent Mental Health Services. We found that if they reported being bullied 
      in the first month after they were first seen by mental health services, they were 
      nearly twice as likely to go on to develop suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

TI  - DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE OF TEXT-MINING ALGORITHMS TO EXTRACT SOCIOECONOMIC 
      STATUS FROM DE-IDENTIFIED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS.
PG  - 230-241
LID - 10.1142/9789813207813_0023 [doi]
AB  - Socioeconomic status (SES) is a fundamental contributor to health, and a key factor 
      underlying racial disparities in disease. However, SES data are rarely included in 
      genetic studies due in part to the difficultly of collecting these data when studies 
      were not originally designed for that purpose. The emergence of large clinic-based 
      biobanks linked to electronic health records (EHRs) provides research access to 
      large patient populations with longitudinal phenotype data captured in structured 
      fields as billing codes, procedure codes, and prescriptions. SES data however, are 
      often not explicitly recorded in structured fields, but rather recorded in the free 
      text of clinical notes and communications. The content and completeness of these 
      data vary widely by practitioner. To enable gene-environment studies that consider 
      SES as an exposure, we sought to extract SES variables from racial/ethnic minority 
      adult patients (n=9,977) in BioVU, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center 
      biorepository linked to de-identified EHRs. We developed several measures of SES 
      using information available within the de-identified EHR, including broad categories 
      of occupation, education, insurance status, and homelessness. Two hundred patients 
      were randomly selected for manual review to develop a set of seven algorithms for 
      extracting SES information from de-identified EHRs. The algorithms consist of 15 
      categories of information, with 830 unique search terms. SES data extracted from 
      manual review of 50 randomly selected records were compared to data produced by the 
      algorithm, resulting in positive predictive values of 80.0% (education), 85.4% 
      (occupation), 87.5% (unemployment), 63.6% (retirement), 23.1% (uninsured), 81.8% 
      (Medicaid), and 33.3% (homelessness), suggesting some categories of SES data are 
      easier to extract in this EHR than others. The SES data extraction approach 
      developed here will enable future EHR-based genetic studies to integrate SES 
      information into statistical analyses. Ultimately, incorporation of measures of SES 
      into genetic studies will help elucidate the impact of the social environment on 
      disease risk and outcomes.

TI  - Medication-indication knowledge bases: a systematic review and critical appraisal.
PG  - 1261-70
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv129 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Medication-indication information is a key part of the information needed 
      for providing decision support for and promoting appropriate use of medications. 
      However, this information is not readily available to end users, and a lot of the 
      resources only contain this information in unstructured form (free text). A number 
      of public knowledge bases (KBs) containing structured medication-indication 
      information have been developed over the years, but a direct comparison of these 
      resources has not yet been conducted. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a 
      systematic review of the literature to identify all medication-indication KBs and 
      critically appraised these resources in terms of their scope as well as their 
      support for complex indication information. RESULTS: We identified 7 KBs containing 
      medication-indication data. They notably differed from each other in terms of their 
      scope, coverage for on- or off-label indications, source of information, and choice 
      of terminologies for representing the knowledge. The majority of KBs had issues with 
      granularity of the indications as well as with representing duration of therapy, 
      primary choice of treatment, and comedications or comorbidities. DISCUSSION AND 
      CONCLUSION: This is the first study directly comparing public KBs of medication 
      indications. We identified several gaps in the existing resources, which can 
      motivate future research.

AB  - Adverse drug events (ADEs) are unintended responses to medical treatment. They can 
      greatly affect a patient's quality of life and present a substantial burden on 
      healthcare. Although Electronic health records (EHRs) document a wealth of 
      information relating to ADEs, they are frequently stored in the unstructured or 
      semi-structured free-text narrative requiring Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
      techniques to mine the relevant information. Here we present a rule-based ADE 
      detection and classification pipeline built and tested on a large Psychiatric corpus 
      comprising 264k patients using the de-identified EHRs of four UK-based psychiatric 
      hospitals. The pipeline uses characteristics specific to Psychiatric EHRs to guide 
      the annotation process, and distinguishes: a) the temporal value associated with the 
      ADE mention (whether it is historical or present), b) the categorical value of the 
      ADE (whether it is assertive, hypothetical, retrospective or a general discussion) 
      and c) the implicit contextual value where the status of the ADE is deduced from 
      surrounding indicators, rather than explicitly stated. We manually created the 
      rulebase in collaboration with clinicians and pharmacists by studying ADE mentions 
      in various types of clinical notes. We evaluated the open-source Adverse Drug Event 
      annotation Pipeline (ADEPt) using 19 ADEs specific to antipsychotics and 
      antidepressants medication. The ADEs chosen vary in severity, regularity and 
      persistence. The average F-measure and accuracy achieved by our tool across all 
      tested ADEs were 0.83 and 0.83 respectively. In addition to annotation power, the 
      ADEPT pipeline presents an improvement to the state of the art context-discerning 
      algorithm, ConText.

AB  - Accurate electronic health records are important for clinical care and research as 
      well as ensuring patient safety. It is crucial for misspelled words to be corrected 
      in order to ensure that medical records are interpreted correctly. This paper 
      describes the development of a spelling correction system for medical text. Our 
      spell checker is based on Shannon's noisy channel model, and uses an extensive 
      dictionary compiled from many sources. We also use named entity recognition, so that 
      names are not wrongly corrected as misspellings. We apply our spell checker to three 
      different types of free-text data: clinical notes, allergy entries, and medication 
      orders; and evaluate its performance on both misspelling detection and correction. 
      Our spell checker achieves detection performance of up to 94.4% and correction 
      accuracy of up to 88.2%. We show that high-performance spelling correction is 
      possible on a variety of clinical documents.

TI  - Identifying adverse drug reactions from free-text electronic hospital health record 
      notes.
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are estimated to be the fifth cause of 
      hospital death. Up to 50% are potentially preventable and a significant number are 
      recurrent (reADRs). Clinical decision support systems have been used to prevent 
      reADRs using structured reporting concerning the patient's ADR experience, which in 
      current clinical practice is poorly performed. Identifying ADRs directly from free 
      text in electronic health records (EHRs) could circumvent this. AIM: To develop 
      strategies to identify ADRs from free-text notes in electronic hospital health 
      records. METHODS: In stage I, the EHRs of 10 patients were reviewed to establish 
      strategies for identifying ADRs. In stage II, complete EHR histories of 45 patients 
      were reviewed for ADRs and compared to the strategies programmed into a rule-based 
      model. ADRs were classified using MedDRA and included in the study if the Naranjo 
      causality score was ≥1. Seriousness was assessed using the European Medicine 
      Agency's important medical event list. RESULTS: In stage I, two main search 
      strategies were identified: keywords indicating an ADR and specific prepositions 
      followed by medication names. In stage II, the EHRs contained a median of 7.4 (range 
      0.01-18) years of medical history covering over 35 000 notes. A total of 318 unique 
      ADRs were identified of which 63 were potentially serious and 179 (sensitivity 57%) 
      were identified by the rule. The method falsely identified 377 ADRs (positive 
      predictive value 32%). However, it also identified an additional eight ADRs. 
      CONCLUSION: Two key strategies were developed to identify ADRs from hospital EHRs 
      using free-text notes. The results appear promising and warrant further study.

TI  - Towards a semantic lexicon for clinical natural language processing.
PG  - 568-76
AB  - A semantic lexicon which associates words and phrases in text to concepts is 
      critical for extracting and encoding clinical information in free text and therefore 
      achieving semantic interoperability between structured and unstructured data in 
      Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Directly using existing standard terminologies may 
      have limited coverage with respect to concepts and their corresponding mentions in 
      text. In this paper, we analyze how tokens and phrases in a large corpus distribute 
      and how well the UMLS captures the semantics. A corpus-driven semantic lexicon, 
      MedLex, has been constructed where the semantics is based on the UMLS assisted with 
      variants mined and usage information gathered from clinical text. The detailed 
      corpus analysis of tokens, chunks, and concept mentions shows the UMLS is an 
      invaluable source for natural language processing. Increasing the semantic coverage 
      of tokens provides a good foundation in capturing clinical information 
      comprehensively. The study also yields some insights in developing practical NLP 
      systems.

PG  - 1019-24
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000788 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Physicians who more intensively interact with electronic health records 
      (EHRs) through their documentation style may pay greater attention to coded fields 
      and clinical decision support and thus may deliver higher quality care. We measured 
      the quality of care of physicians who used three predominating EHR documentation 
      styles: dictation, structured documentation, and free text. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective analysis of visits by patients with coronary artery disease and 
      diabetes to the Partners Primary Care Practice Based Research Network. The main 
      outcome measures were 15 EHR-based coronary artery disease and diabetes measures 
      assessed 30 days after primary care visits. RESULTS: During the 9-month study 
      period, 7000 coronary artery disease and diabetes patients made 18 569 visits to 234 
      primary care physicians of whom 20 (9%) predominantly dictated their notes, 68 (29%) 
      predominantly used structured documentation, and 146 (62%) predominantly typed free 
      text notes. In multivariable modeling adjusted for clustering by patient and 
      physician, quality of care appeared significantly worse for dictators than for 
      physicians using the other two documentation styles on three of 15 measures 
      (antiplatelet medication, tobacco use documentation, and diabetic eye exam); better 
      for structured documenters for three measures (blood pressure documentation, body 
      mass index documentation, and diabetic foot exam); and better for free text 
      documenters on one measure (influenza vaccination). There was no measure for which 
      dictators had higher quality of care than physicians using the other two 
      documentation styles. CONCLUSIONS: EHR-assessed quality is necessarily 
      documentation-dependent, but physicians who dictated their notes appeared to have 
      worse quality of care than physicians who used structured EHR documentation.

TI  - The association between neighbourhood characteristics and physical victimisation in 
      men and women with mental disorders.
PG  - e73
LID - 10.1192/bjo.2020.52 [doi]
LID - e73
AB  - BACKGROUND: How neighbourhood characteristics affect the physical safety of people 
      with mental illness is unclear. AIMS: To examine neighbourhood effects on physical 
      victimisation towards people using mental health services. METHOD: We developed and 
      evaluated a machine-learning-derived free-text-based natural language processing 
      (NLP) algorithm to ascertain clinical text referring to physical victimisation. This 
      was applied to records on all patients attending National Health Service mental 
      health services in Southeast London. Sociodemographic and clinical data, and 
      diagnostic information on use of acute hospital care (from Hospital Episode 
      Statistics, linked to Clinical Record Interactive Search), were collected in this 
      group, defined as 'cases' and concurrently sampled controls. Multilevel logistic 
      regression models estimated associations (odds ratios, ORs) between 
      neighbourhood-level fragmentation, crime, income deprivation, and population density 
      and physical victimisation. RESULTS: Based on a human-rated gold standard, the NLP 
      algorithm had a positive predictive value of 0.92 and sensitivity of 0.98 for 
      (clinically recorded) physical victimisation. A 1 s.d. increase in neighbourhood 
      crime was accompanied by a 7% increase in odds of physical victimisation in women 
      and an 13% increase in men (adjusted OR (aOR) for women: 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14, aOR 
      for men: 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.21, P for gender interaction, 0.218). Although small, 
      adjusted associations for neighbourhood fragmentation appeared greater in magnitude 
      for women (aOR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.11) than men, where this association was not 
      statistically significant (aOR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.95-1.04, P for gender interaction, 
      0.096). Neighbourhood income deprivation was associated with victimisation in men 
      and women with similar magnitudes of association. CONCLUSIONS: Neighbourhood factors 
      influencing safety, as well as individual characteristics including gender, may be 
      relevant to understanding pathways to physical victimisation towards people with

TI  - An analysis of free-text alcohol use documentation in the electronic health record: 
      early findings and implications.
PG  - 402-15
LID - 10.4338/ACI-2013-12-RA-0101 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol use is a significant part of a patient's history, but details 
      about consumption are not always documented. Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems 
      have the potential to improve assessment of alcohol use and misuse; however, a 
      challenge is that critical information may be documented primarily in free-text 
      rather than in a structured and standardized format, thereby limiting its use. 
      OBJECTIVE: To characterize the use and contents of free-text documentation for 
      alcohol use in the social history module of an EHR. METHODS: This study involved a 
      retrospective analysis of 500 alcohol use entries that include structured fields as 
      well as a free-text comment field. Two coding schemes were developed and used to 
      analyze these entries for: (1) quantifying the reasons for using free-text comments 
      and (2) categorizing information in the free-text into separate elements. In 
      addition, for entries indicating possible alcohol misuse, a preliminary review of 
      other structured parts of the EHR was conducted to determine if this was also 
      documented elsewhere. RESULTS: The top three reasons for using free-text were 
      limited ability to describe alcohol use frequency (75%), amount (22%), and status 
      (18%) with available structured fields. Within the free-text, descriptions of 
      frequency were most common (79%) using words or phrases conveying occasional (61%), 
      daily (13%), or weekly (12%) use. Of the 36 cases suggesting alcohol misuse, 44% had 
      mention of alcohol problems in the problem list or past medical history. 
      CONCLUSIONS: BASED ON THE EARLY FINDINGS, IMPLICATIONS FOR IMPROVING THE STRUCTURED 
      COLLECTION AND USE OF ALCOHOL USE INFORMATION IN THE EHR ARE PROVIDED IN FOUR AREAS: 
      (1) system enhancements, (2) user training, (3) decision support, and (4) standards. 
      Next steps include examining how alcohol use is documented in other parts of the EHR 
      (e.g., clinical notes) and how documentation practices vary based on patient, 
      provider, and clinic characteristics.

LID - 10.1002/rth2.12505 [doi]
LID - e12505
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bleeding is associated with a significantly increased morbidity and 
      mortality. Bleeding events are often described in the unstructured text of 
      electronic health records, which makes them difficult to identify by manual 
      inspection. OBJECTIVES: To develop a deep learning model that detects and visualizes 
      bleeding events in electronic health records. PATIENTS/METHODS: Three hundred 
      electronic health records with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth 
      Revision diagnosis codes for bleeding or leukemia were extracted. Each sentence in 
      the electronic health record was annotated as positive or negative for bleeding. The 
      annotated sentences were used to develop a deep learning model that detects bleeding 
      at sentence and note level. RESULTS: On a balanced test set of 1178   sentences, the 
      best-performing deep learning model achieved a sensitivity of 0.90, specificity of 
      0.90, and negative predictive value of 0.90. On a test set consisting of 700 notes, 
      of which 49 were positive for bleeding, the model achieved a note-level sensitivity 
      of 1.00, specificity of 0.52, and negative predictive value of 1.00. By using a 
      sentence-level model on a note level, the model can explain its predictions by 
      visualizing the exact sentence in a note that contains information regarding 
      bleeding. Moreover, we found that the model performed consistently well across 
      different types of bleedings. CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning model can be used to 
      detect and visualize bleeding events in the free text of electronic health records. 
      The deep learning model can thus facilitate systematic assessment of bleeding risk, 
      and thereby optimize patient care and safety.

TI  - Examining the use, contents, and quality of free-text tobacco use documentation in 
      the Electronic Health Record.
PG  - 366-74
AB  - Recent initiatives have emphasized the potential role of Electronic Health Record 
      (EHR) systems for improving tobacco use assessment and cessation. In support of 
      these efforts, the goal of the present study was to examine tobacco use 
      documentation in the EHR with an emphasis on free-text. Three coding schemes were 
      developed and applied to analyze 525 tobacco use entries, including structured 
      fields and a free-text comment field, from the social history module of an EHR 
      system to characterize: (1) potential reasons for using free-text, (2) contents 
      within the free-text, and (3) data quality issues. Free-text was most commonly used 
      due to limitations for describing tobacco use amount (23.2%), frequency (26.9%), and 
      start or quit dates (28.2%) as well as secondhand smoke exposure (17.9%) using a 
      variety of words and phrases. The collective results provide insights for informing 
      system enhancements, user training, natural language processing, and standards for 
      tobacco use documentation.

TI  - Extracting antipsychotic polypharmacy data from electronic health records: 
      developing and evaluating a novel process.
PG  - 166
LID - 10.1186/s12888-015-0557-z [doi]
LID - 166
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic prescription information is commonly derived from 
      structured fields in clinical health records. However, utilising diverse and 
      comprehensive sources of information is especially important when investigating less 
      frequent patterns of medication prescribing such as antipsychotic polypharmacy 
      (APP). This study describes and evaluates a novel method of extracting APP data from 
      both structured and free-text fields in electronic health records (EHRs), and its 
      use for research purposes. METHODS: Using anonymised EHRs, we identified a cohort of 
      patients with serious mental illness (SMI) who were treated in South London and 
      Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust mental health care services between 1 January and 30 
      June 2012. Information about antipsychotic co-prescribing was extracted using a 
      combination of natural language processing and a bespoke algorithm. The validity of 
      the data derived through this process was assessed against a manually coded gold 
      standard to establish precision and recall. Lastly, we estimated the prevalence and 
      patterns of antipsychotic polypharmacy. RESULTS: Individual instances of 
      antipsychotic prescribing were detected with high precision (0.94 to 0.97) and 
      moderate recall (0.57-0.77). We detected baseline APP (two or more antipsychotics 
      prescribed in any 6-week window) with 0.92 precision and 0.74 recall and long-term 
      APP (antipsychotic co-prescribing for 6 months) with 0.94 precision and 0.60 recall. 
      Of the 7,201 SMI patients receiving active care during the observation period, 338 
      (4.7 %; 95 % CI 4.2-5.2) were identified as receiving long-term APP. Two second 
      generation antipsychotics (64.8 %); and first -second generation antipsychotics were 
      most commonly co-prescribed (32.5 %). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that this 
      is a potentially practical tool for identifying polypharmacy from mental health EHRs 
      on a large scale. Furthermore, extracted data can be used to allow researchers to 
      characterize patterns of polypharmacy over time including different drug 
      combinations, trends in polypharmacy prescribing, predictors of polypharmacy 
      prescribing and the impact of polypharmacy on patient outcomes.

AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the current situation of electronic health records 
      (EHRs) and patient registries in the oncology departments of hospitals in Spain. 
      METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted from December 2018 to September 
      2019. The survey was designed ad hoc by the Outcomes Evaluation and Clinical 
      Practice Section of the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (SEOM) and was 
      distributed to all head of medical oncology department members of SEOM. RESULTS: We 
      invited 148 heads of oncology departments, and 81 (54.7%) questionnaires were 
      completed, with representation from all 17 Spanish autonomous communities. 
      Seventy-seven (95%) of the respondents had EHRs implemented at their hospitals; of 
      them, over 80% considered EHRs to have a positive impact on work organization and 
      clinical practice, and 73% considered that EHRs improve the quality of patient care. 
      In contrast, 27 (35.1%) of these respondents felt that EHRs worsened the 
      physician-patient relationship and conveyed an additional workload (n = 29; 37.6%). 
      Several drawbacks in the implementation of EHRs were identified, including the 
      limited inclusion of information on both outpatients and inpatients, information 
      recorded in free text data fields, and the availability of specific informed 
      consent. Forty-six (56.7%) respondents had patient registries where they recorded 
      information from all patients seen in the department. CONCLUSION: Our study 
      indicates that EHRs are almost universally implemented in the hospitals surveyed and 
      are considered to have a positive impact on work organization and clinical practice. 
      However, EHRs currently have several drawbacks that limit their use for 
      investigational purposes. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of Anonym, a tool for 
      de-identifying free-text health records based on conditional random fields 
      classifiers informed by linguistic and lexical features, as well as features 
      extracted by pattern matching techniques. De-identification of personal health 
      information in electronic health records is essential for the sharing and secondary 
      usage of clinical data. De-identification tools that adapt to different sources of 
      clinical data are attractive as they would require minimal intervention to guarantee 
      high effectiveness. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The effectiveness and robustness of 
      Anonym are evaluated across multiple datasets, including the widely adopted 
      Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) dataset, used for evaluation in a 
      de-identification challenge. The datasets used here vary in type of health records, 
      source of data, and their quality, with one of the datasets containing optical 
      character recognition errors. RESULTS: Anonym identifies and removes up to 96.6% of 
      personal health identifiers (recall) with a precision of up to 98.2% on the i2b2 
      dataset, outperforming the best system proposed in the i2b2 challenge. The 
      effectiveness of Anonym across datasets is found to depend on the amount of 
      information available for training. CONCLUSION: Findings show that Anonym compares 
      to the best approach from the 2006 i2b2 shared task. It is easy to retrain Anonym 
      with new datasets; if retrained, the system is robust to variations of training 
      size, data type and quality in presence of sufficient training data.

TI  - Building a tobacco user registry by extracting multiple smoking behaviors from 
      clinical notes.
PG  - 141

LID - 141
AB  - BACKGROUND: Usage of structured fields in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to 
      ascertain smoking history is important but fails in capturing the nuances of smoking 
      behaviors. Knowledge of smoking behaviors, such as pack year history and most recent 
      cessation date, allows care providers to select the best care plan for patients at 
      risk of smoking attributable diseases. METHODS: We developed and evaluated a health 
      informatics pipeline for identifying complete smoking history from clinical notes in 
      EHRs. We utilized 758 patient-visit notes (from visits between 03/28/2016 and 
      04/04/2016) from our local EHR in addition to a public dataset of 502 clinical notes 
      from the 2006 i2b2 Challenge to assess the performance of this pipeline. We used a 
      machine-learning classifier to extract smoking status and a comprehensive set of 
      text processing regular expressions to extract pack years and cessation date 
      information from these clinical notes. RESULTS: We identified smoking status with an 
      F1 score of 0.90 on both the i2b2 and local data sets. Regular expression 
      identification of pack year history in the local test set was 91.7% sensitive and 
      95.2% specific, but due to variable context the pack year extraction was incomplete 
      in 25% of cases, extracting packs per day or years smoked only. Regular expression 
      identification of cessation date was 63.2% sensitive and 94.6% specific. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our work indicates that the development of an EHR-based Smokers' 
      Registry containing information relating to smoking behaviors, not just status, from 
      free-text clinical notes using an informatics pipeline is feasible. This pipeline is 
      capable of functioning in external EHRs, reducing the amount of time and money 
      needed at the institute-level to create a Smokers' Registry for improved 
      identification of patient risk and eligibility for preventative and early detection 
      services.

TI  - Clinical Named Entity Recognition From Chinese Electronic Health Records via Machine 
      Learning Methods.
PG  - e50
LID - 10.2196/medinform.9965 [doi]
LID - e50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs) are important data resources for 
      clinical studies and applications. Physicians or clinicians describe patients' 
      disorders or treatment procedures in EHRs using free text (unstructured) clinical 
      notes. The narrative information plays an important role in patient treatment and 
      clinical research. However, it is challenging to make machines understand the 
      clinical narratives. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to automatically identify Chinese 
      clinical entities from free text in EHRs and make machines semantically understand 
      diagnoses, tests, body parts, symptoms, treatments, and so on. METHODS: The dataset 
      we used for this study is the benchmark dataset with human annotated Chinese EHRs, 
      released by the China Conference on Knowledge Graph and Semantic Computing 2017 
      clinical named entity recognition challenge task. Overall, 2 machine learning 
      models, the conditional random fields (CRF) method and bidirectional long short-term 
      memory (LSTM)-CRF, were applied to recognize clinical entities from Chinese EHR 
      data. To train the CRF-based model, we selected features such as bag of Chinese 
      characters, part-of-speech tags, character types, and the position of characters. 
      For the bidirectional LSTM-CRF-based model, character embeddings and segmentation 
      information were used as features. In addition, we also employed a dictionary-based 
      approach as the baseline for the purpose of performance evaluation. Precision, 
      recall, and the harmonic average of precision and recall (F1 score) were used to 
      evaluate the performance of the methods. RESULTS: Experiments on the test set showed 
      that our methods were able to automatically identify types of Chinese clinical 
      entities such as diagnosis, test, symptom, body part, and treatment simultaneously. 
      With regard to overall performance, CRF and bidirectional LSTM-CRF achieved a 
      precision of 0.9203 and 0.9112, recall of 0.8709 and 0.8974, and F1 score of 0.8949 
      and 0.9043, respectively. The results also indicated that our methods performed well 
      in recognizing each type of clinical entity, in which the "symptom" type achieved 
      the best F1 score of over 0.96. Moreover, as the number of features increased, the 
      F1 score of the CRF model increased from 0.8547 to 0.8949. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      study, we employed two computational methods to simultaneously identify types of 
      Chinese clinical entities from free text in EHRs. With training, these methods can 
      effectively identify various types of clinical entities (eg, symptom and treatment) 
      with high accuracy. The deep learning model, bidirectional LSTM-CRF, can achieve 
      better performance than the CRF model with little feature engineering. This study 
      contributed to translating human-readable health information into machine-readable 
      information.

TI  - Improving Electronic Health Record Note Comprehension With NoteAid: Randomized Trial 
      of Electronic Health Record Note Comprehension Interventions With Crowdsourced 
      Workers.
PG  - e10793
LID - 10.2196/10793 [doi]
LID - e10793
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient portals are becoming more common, and with them, the ability of 
      patients to access their personal electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs, in 
      particular the free-text EHR notes, often contain medical jargon and terms that are 
      difficult for laypersons to understand. There are many Web-based resources for 
      learning more about particular diseases or conditions, including systems that 
      directly link to lay definitions or educational materials for medical concepts. 
      OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to determine whether use of one such tool, NoteAid, leads to 
      higher EHR note comprehension ability. We use a new EHR note comprehension 
      assessment tool instead of patient self-reported scores. METHODS: In this work, we 
      compare a passive, self-service educational resource (MedlinePlus) with an active 
      resource (NoteAid) where definitions are provided to the user for medical concepts 
      that the system identifies. We use Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to recruit 
      individuals to complete ComprehENotes, a new test of EHR note comprehension. 
      RESULTS: Mean scores for individuals with access to NoteAid are significantly higher 
      than the mean baseline scores, both for raw scores (P=.008) and estimated ability 
      (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: In our experiments, we show that the active intervention leads 
      to significantly higher scores on the comprehension test as compared with a baseline 
      group with no resources provided. In contrast, there is no significant difference 
      between the group that was provided with the passive intervention and the baseline 
      group. Finally, we analyze the demographics of the individuals who participated in 
      our AMT task and show differences between groups that align with the current 
      understanding of health literacy between populations. This is the first work to show 
      improvements in comprehension using tools such as NoteAid as measured by an EHR note 
      comprehension assessment tool as opposed to patient self-reported scores.

TI  - Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Algorithms to Automate the 
      Evaluation of Clinical Decision Support in Electronic Medical Record Systems.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: As the number of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) 
      incorporated into electronic medical records (EMRs) increases, so does the need to 
      evaluate their effectiveness. The use of medical record review and similar manual 
      methods for evaluating decision rules is laborious and inefficient. The authors use 
      machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to accurately 
      evaluate a clinical decision support rule through an EMR system, and they compare it 
      against manual evaluation. METHODS: Modeled after the EMR system EPIC at Maine 
      Medical Center, we developed a dummy data set containing physician notes in free 
      text for 3,621 artificial patients records undergoing a head computed tomography 
      (CT) scan for mild traumatic brain injury after the incorporation of an electronic 
      best practice approach. We validated the accuracy of the Best Practice Advisories 
      (BPA) using three machine learning algorithms-C-Support Vector Classification (SVC), 
      Decision Tree Classifier (DecisionTreeClassifier), k-nearest neighbors classifier 
      (KNeighborsClassifier)-by comparing their accuracy for adjudicating the occurrence 
      of a mild traumatic brain injury against manual review. We then used the best of the 
      three algorithms to evaluate the effectiveness of the BPA, and we compared the 
      algorithm's evaluation of the BPA to that of manual review. RESULTS: The electronic 
      best practice approach was found to have a sensitivity of 98.8 percent 
      (96.83-100.0), specificity of 10.3 percent, PPV = 7.3 percent, and NPV = 99.2 
      percent when reviewed manually by abstractors. Though all the machine learning 
      algorithms were observed to have a high level of prediction, the SVC displayed the 
      highest with a sensitivity 93.33 percent (92.49-98.84), specificity of 97.62 percent 
      (96.53-98.38), PPV = 50.00, NPV = 99.83. The SVC algorithm was observed to have a 
      sensitivity of 97.9 percent (94.7-99.86), specificity 10.30 percent, PPV 7.25 
      percent, and NPV 99.2 percent for evaluating the best practice approach, after 
      accounting for 17 cases (0.66 percent) where the patient records had to be reviewed 
      manually due to the NPL systems inability to capture the proper diagnosis. 
      DISCUSSION: CDSSs incorporated into EMRs can be evaluated in an automatic fashion by 
      using NLP and machine learning techniques.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are among the leading causes of death 
      globally. Electronic health records (EHRs) provide a rich data source for research 
      on CVD risk factors, treatments and outcomes. Researchers must be confident in the 
      validity of diagnoses in EHRs, particularly when diagnosis definitions and use of 
      EHRs change over time. Our systematic review provides an up-to-date appraisal of the 
      validity of stroke, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and heart failure (HF) diagnoses 
      in European primary and secondary care EHRs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will 
      systematically review the published and grey literature to identify studies 
      validating diagnoses of stroke, ACS and HF in European EHRs. MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, OpenGrey and EThOS will be searched from 
      the dates of inception to April 2019. A prespecified search strategy of subject 
      headings and free-text terms in the title and abstract will be used. Two reviewers 
      will independently screen titles and abstracts to identify eligible studies, 
      followed by full-text review. We require studies to compare clinical codes with a 
      suitable reference standard. Additionally, at least one validation measure 
      (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value or negative predictive value) 
      or raw data, for the calculation of a validation measure, is necessary. We will then 
      extract data from the eligible studies using standardised tables and assess risk of 
      bias in individual studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy 
      Studies 2 tool. Data will be synthesised into a narrative format and heterogeneity 
      assessed. Meta-analysis will be considered when a sufficient number of homogeneous 
      studies are available. The overall quality of evidence will be assessed using the 
      Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: This is a systematic review, so it does not require ethical approval. 
      Our results will be submitted for peer-review publication. PROSPERO REGISTRATION

TI  - Predicting Unplanned Readmissions Following a Hip or Knee Arthroplasty: 
      Retrospective Observational Study.
PG  - e19761
LID - 10.2196/19761 [doi]
LID - e19761
AB  - BACKGROUND: Total joint replacements are high-volume and high-cost procedures that 
      should be monitored for cost and quality control. Models that can identify patients 
      at high risk of readmission might help reduce costs by suggesting who should be 
      enrolled in preventive care programs. Previous models for risk prediction have 
      relied on structured data of patients rather than clinical notes in electronic 
      health records (EHRs). The former approach requires manual feature extraction by 
      domain experts, which may limit the applicability of these models. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aims to develop and evaluate a machine learning model for predicting the risk 
      of 30-day readmission following knee and hip arthroplasty procedures. The input data 
      for these models come from raw EHRs. We empirically demonstrate that unstructured 
      free-text notes contain a reasonably predictive signal for this task. METHODS: We 
      performed a retrospective analysis of data from 7174 patients at Partners Healthcare 
      collected between 2006 and 2016. These data were split into train, validation, and 
      test sets. These data sets were used to build, validate, and test models to predict 
      unplanned readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge. The proposed models made 
      predictions on the basis of clinical notes, obviating the need for performing manual 
      feature extraction by domain and machine learning experts. The notes that served as 
      model inputs were written by physicians, nurses, pathologists, and others who 
      diagnose and treat patients and may have their own predictions, even if these are 
      not recorded. RESULTS: The proposed models output readmission risk scores 
      (propensities) for each patient. The best models (as selected on a development set) 
      yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.846 (95% CI 
      82.75-87.11) for hip and 0.822 (95% CI 80.94-86.22) for knee surgery, indicating 
      reasonable discriminative ability. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models can predict 
      which patients are at a high risk of readmission within 30 days following hip and 
      knee arthroplasty procedures on the basis of notes in EHRs with reasonable 
      discriminative power. Following further validation and empirical demonstration that 
      the models realize predictive performance above that which clinical judgment may 
      provide, such models may be used to build an automated decision support tool to help 
      caretakers identify at-risk patients.

PG  - 547-55
LID - 10.1038/clpt.2013.47 [doi]
AB  - With increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), there is an 
      opportunity to use the free-text portion of EHRs for pharmacovigilance. We present 
      novel methods that annotate the unstructured clinical notes and transform them into 
      a deidentified patient-feature matrix encoded using medical terminologies. We 
      demonstrate the use of the resulting high-throughput data for detecting drug-adverse 
      event associations and adverse events associated with drug-drug interactions. We 
      show that these methods flag adverse events early (in most cases before an official 
      alert), allow filtering of spurious signals by adjusting for potential confounding, 
      and compile prevalence information. We argue that analyzing large volumes of 
      free-text clinical notes enables drug safety surveillance using a yet untapped data 
      source. Such data mining can be used for hypothesis generation and for rapid 
      analysis of suspected adverse event risk.

      cancer in the United Kingdom.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological research on small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is limited and 
      based on cancer registry data. We evaluated the feasibility and validity of using 
      primary care electronic health records (The Health Improvement Network [THIN]) in 
      the UK to identify and characterise SCLC. METHODS: We searched THIN records of 
      individuals aged 18-89 years between 2000 and 2014 for a first diagnostic code 
      suggestive of lung cancer (group 1) or small cell cancer (SCC; group 2) and for text 
      strings among free text comments to identify and characterise incident SCLC cases. 
      We validated our case identification strategy by manual review of patient EHRs, 
      including free text comments, for a random sample of 400 individuals initially 
      detected with a diagnostic code (300 from group 1 and 100 from group 2). RESULTS: 
      Twenty five thousand two hundred fourty one individuals had a code for lung cancer 
      (n = 24,508 [97.1%]) or SCC (733 [2.9%]). Following free-text searches, there were 
      3530 incident SCLC cases (2956 from group 1; 574 from group 2) corresponding to an 
      incidence rate of 1.01 per 10,000 person-years. In the validation exercise, SCLC 
      confirmation rates were 99% (group 1) and 85% (group 2). Mean age at diagnosis among 
      confirmed cases was 68.5 years; staging information was present in 63.5% of cases of 
      whom 17.8% had limited disease and 82.2% had extensive disease. The majority (84.5%) 
      had a recorded symptom suggestive of lung cancer; chest infection was the most 
      common (18%) followed by cough (15.8%) and chest/abdominal/back pain (15.2%). The 
      first year crude mortality rates was 9.9 per 100 person-months (95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 9.5-10.4), was higher among men and those aged 80 years and above. A 
      total of 144 (37.8%) confirmed cases had metastases recorded. Median survival among 
      the whole study cohort was 7.37 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our SCLC case identification 
      method appears to be valid and could potentially be adapted to identify other cancer 
      types. However, complete characterisation of staging requires information from 
      additional data sources including cancer registries.

TI  - Terminology Services: Standard Terminologies to Control Health Vocabulary.
PG  - 227-233

AB  - Healthcare Information Systems should capture clinical data in a structured and 
      preferably coded format. This is crucial for data exchange between health 
      information systems, epidemiological analysis, quality and research, clinical 
      decision support systems, administrative functions, among others. Structured data 
      entry is an obstacle for the usability of electronic health record (EHR) 
      applications and their acceptance by physicians who prefer to document patient EHRs 
      using "free text". Natural language allows for rich expressiveness but at the same 
      time is ambiguous; it has great dependence on context and uses jargon and acronyms. 
      Although much progress has been made in knowledge and natural language processing 
      techniques, the result is not yet satisfactory enough for the use of free text in 
      all dimensions of clinical documentation. In order to address the trade-off between 
      capturing data with free text and at the same time coding data for computer 
      processing, numerous terminological systems for the systematic recording of clinical 
      data have been developed. The purpose of terminology services consists of 
      representing facts that happen in the real world through database management in 
      order to allow for semantic interoperability and computerized applications. These 
      systems interrelate concepts of a particular domain and provide references to 
      related terms with standards codes. In this way, standard terminologies allow the 
      creation of a controlled medical vocabulary, making terminology services a 
      fundamental component for health data management in the healthcare environment. The 
      Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires has been working in the development of its own 
      terminology server. This work describes its experience in the field.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical care guidelines recommend that newly diagnosed prostate cancer 
      patients at high risk for metastatic spread receive a bone scan prior to treatment 
      and that low risk patients not receive it. The objective was to develop an automated 
      pipeline to interrogate heterogeneous data to evaluate the use of bone scans using a 
      two different Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Our cohort was divided into risk groups based on Electronic Health Records (EHR). 
      Information on bone scan utilization was identified in both structured data and free 
      text from clinical notes. Our pipeline annotated sentences with a combination of a 
      rule-based method using the ConText algorithm (a generalization of NegEx) and a 
      Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method using word2vec to produce word embeddings. 
      RESULTS: A total of 5500 patients and 369,764 notes were included in the study. A 
      total of 39% of patients were high-risk and 73% of these received a bone scan; of 
      the 18% low risk patients, 10% received one. The accuracy of CNN model outperformed 
      the rule-based model one (F-measure = 0.918 and 0.897 respectively). We demonstrate 
      a combination of both models could maximize precision or recall, based on the study 
      question. CONCLUSION: Using structured data, we accurately classified patients' 
      cancer risk group, identified bone scan documentation with two NLP methods, and 
      evaluated guideline adherence. Our pipeline can be used to provide concrete feedback 
      to clinicians and guide treatment decisions.

TI  - Semantic computational analysis of anticoagulation use in atrial fibrillation from 
      real world data.
PG  - e0225625

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and significantly increases 
      stroke risk. This risk is effectively managed by oral anticoagulation. Recent 
      studies using national registry data indicate increased use of anticoagulation 
      resulting from changes in guidelines and the availability of newer drugs. The aim of 
      this study is to develop and validate an open source risk scoring pipeline for 
      free-text electronic health record data using natural language processing. AF 
      patients discharged from 1st January 2011 to 1st October 2017 were identified from 
      discharge summaries (N = 10,030, 64.6% male, average age 75.3 ± 12.3 years). A 
      natural language processing pipeline was developed to identify risk factors in 
      clinical text and calculate risk for ischaemic stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc) and bleeding 
      (HAS-BLED). Scores were validated vs two independent experts for 40 patients. 
      Automatic risk scores were in strong agreement with the two independent experts for 
      CHA2DS2-VASc (average kappa 0.78 vs experts, compared to 0.85 between experts). 
      Agreement was lower for HAS-BLED (average kappa 0.54 vs experts, compared to 0.74 
      between experts). In high-risk patients (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥2) OAC use has increased 
      significantly over the last 7 years, driven by the availability of DOACs and the 
      transitioning of patients from AP medication alone to OAC. Factors independently 
      associated with OAC use included components of the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores 
      as well as discharging specialty and frailty. OAC use was highest in patients 
      discharged under cardiology (69%). Electronic health record text can be used for 
      automatic calculation of clinical risk scores at scale. Open source tools are 
      available today for this task but require further validation. Analysis of routinely 
      collected EHR data can replicate findings from large-scale curated registries.

PG  - 91-6
LID - 10.1097/PTS.0b013e3181dcae06 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Relatively little is known about rates of outpatient adverse drug events 
      (ADEs), and most health systems do not routinely identify them. We developed a 
      computerized ADE measurement process and used it to detect ADEs from electronic 
      health records and then categorized them according to type, preventability, and 
      severity. METHODS: The rules used represent combinations of variables including 
      coded medication names, laboratory results, diagnoses, and specific items such as 
      symptoms from free text clinician notes, all obtained from electronic health 
      records. Rules targeted various diagnostic and laboratory abnormalities potentially 
      caused by a broad range of outpatient medications commonly used in primary care. The 
      rules were run on 4 months of data on primary care patients seen in the outpatient 
      setting in 2 large health systems; possible incidents were identified by chart 
      review and validated as ADEs by clinician reviewers, then rated by severity and 
      preventability. RESULTS: The rates of ADEs were 75 ADEs/1000 person-years and 
      198/1000 person-years at the 2 sites, respectively. The overall rate was 138 
      ADEs/1000 person-years across the 2 sites. Eleven percent of ADEs were preventable, 
      with a rate of 15 preventable ADEs/1000 person-years across sites. Approximately 
      one-fourth of ADEs were serious or life threatening at both sites. The highest yield 
      rules for identifying preventable ADEs included rules based on drug classes and 
      symptoms, and drug-laboratory rules. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse drug events occurred 
      frequently in routine outpatient care, and many were serious and preventable. 
      Computerized monitoring represents an efficacious approach for identifying 
      ambulatory ADEs, although it needs additional refinement. In addition, site-specific 
      variations need further exploration.

TI  - Enhanced Quality Measurement Event Detection: An Application to Physician Reporting.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.13063/2327-9214.1270 [doi]
LID - 5
AB  - The wide-scale adoption of electronic health records (EHR)s has increased the 
      availability of routinely collected clinical data in electronic form that can be 
      used to improve the reporting of quality of care. However, the bulk of information 
      in the EHR is in unstructured form (e.g., free-text clinical notes) and not amenable 
      to automated reporting. Traditional methods are based on structured diagnostic and 
      billing data that provide efficient, but inaccurate or incomplete summaries of 
      actual or relevant care processes and patient outcomes. To assess the feasibility 
      and benefit of implementing enhanced EHR- based physician quality measurement and 
      reporting, which includes the analysis of unstructured free- text clinical notes, we 
      conducted a retrospective study to compare traditional and enhanced approaches for 
      reporting ten physician quality measures from multiple National Quality Strategy 
      domains. We found that our enhanced approach enabled the calculation of five 
      Physician Quality and Performance System measures not measureable in billing or 
      diagnostic codes and resulted in over a five-fold increase in event at an average 
      precision of 88 percent (95 percent CI: 83-93 percent). Our work suggests that 
      enhanced EHR-based quality measurement can increase event detection for establishing 
      value-based payment arrangements and can expedite quality reporting for physician 
      practices, which are increasingly burdened by the process of manual chart review for 
      quality reporting.

TI  - FABLE: A Semi-Supervised Prescription Information Extraction System.
PG  - 1534-1543
AB  - Prescription information is an important component of electronic health records 
      (EHRs). This information contains detailed medication instructions that are crucial 
      for patients' well-being and is often detailed in the narrative portions of EHRs. As 
      a result, narratives of EHRs need to be processed with natural language processing 
      (NLP) methods that can extract medication and prescription information from free 
      text. However, automatic methods for medication and prescription extraction from 
      narratives face two major challenges: (1) dictionaries can fall short even when 
      identifying well-defined and syntactically consistent categories of medication 
      entities, (2) some categories of medication entities are sparse, and at the same 
      time lexically (and syntactically) diverse. In this paper, we describe FABLE, a 
      system for automatically extracting prescription information from discharge 
      summaries. FABLE utilizes unannotated data to enhance annotated training data: it 
      performs semi-supervised extraction of medication information using pseudo-labels 
      with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to improve its understanding of incomplete, 
      sparse, and diverse medication entities. When evaluated against the official 
      benchmark set from the 2009 i2b2 Shared Task and Workshop on Medication Extraction, 
      FABLE achieves a horizontal phrase-level F1-measure of 0.878, giving 
      state-of-the-art performance and significantly improving on nearly all entity 
      categories.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Natural language processing (NLP) methods have the capability to process 
      clinical free text in electronic health records, decreasing the need for costly 
      manual chart review, and improving data quality. We developed rule-based NLP 
      algorithms to automatically extract surgery specific data elements from knee 
      arthroplasty operative notes. METHODS: Within a cohort of 20,000 knee arthroplasty 
      operative notes from 2000 to 2017 at a large tertiary institution, we randomly 
      selected independent pairs of training and test sets to develop and evaluate NLP 
      algorithms to detect five major data elements. The size of the training and test 
      datasets were similar and ranged between 420 to 1592 surgeries. Expert rules using 
      keywords in operative notes were used to implement NLP algorithms capturing: (1) 
      category of surgery (total knee arthroplasty, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, 
      patellofemoral arthroplasty), (2) laterality of surgery, (3) constraint type, (4) 
      presence of patellar resurfacing, and (5) implant model (catalog numbers). We used 
      institutional registry data as our gold standard to evaluate the NLP algorithms. 
      RESULTS: NLP algorithms to detect the category of surgery, laterality, constraint, 
      and patellar resurfacing achieved 98.3%, 99.5%, 99.2%, and 99.4% accuracy on test 
      datasets, respectively. The implant model algorithm achieved an F1-score (harmonic 
      mean of precision and recall) of 99.9%. CONCLUSIONS: NLP algorithms are a promising 
      alternative to costly manual chart review to automate the extraction of embedded 
      information within knee arthroplasty operative notes. Further validation in other 
      hospital settings will enhance widespread implementation and efficiency in data 
      capture for research and clinical purposes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

TI  - Validation of a Natural Language Processing Algorithm for Detecting Infectious 
      Disease Symptoms in Primary Care Electronic Medical Records in Singapore.
PG  - e36
LID - 10.2196/medinform.8204 [doi]
LID - e36
AB  - BACKGROUND: Free-text clinical records provide a source of information that 
      complements traditional disease surveillance. To electronically harness these 
      records, they need to be transformed into codified fields by natural language 
      processing algorithms. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop, train, and 
      validate Clinical History Extractor for Syndromic Surveillance (CHESS), an natural 
      language processing algorithm to extract clinical information from free-text primary 
      care records. METHODS: CHESS is a keyword-based natural language processing 
      algorithm to extract 48 signs and symptoms suggesting respiratory infections, 
      gastrointestinal infections, constitutional, as well as other signs and symptoms 
      potentially associated with infectious diseases. The algorithm also captured the 
      assertion status (affirmed, negated, or suspected) and symptom duration. Electronic 
      medical records from the National Healthcare Group Polyclinics, a major public 
      sector primary care provider in Singapore, were randomly extracted and manually 
      reviewed by 2 human reviewers, with a third reviewer as the adjudicator. The 
      algorithm was evaluated based on 1680 notes against the human-coded result as the 
      reference standard, with half of the data used for training and the other half for 
      validation. RESULTS: The symptoms most commonly present within the 1680 clinical 
      records at the episode level were those typically present in respiratory infections 
      such as cough (744/7703, 9.66%), sore throat (591/7703, 7.67%), rhinorrhea 
      (552/7703, 7.17%), and fever (928/7703, 12.04%). At the episode level, CHESS had an 
      overall performance of 96.7% precision and 97.6% recall on the training dataset and 
      96.0% precision and 93.1% recall on the validation dataset. Symptoms suggesting 
      respiratory and gastrointestinal infections were all detected with more than 90% 
      precision and recall. CHESS correctly assigned the assertion status in 97.3%, 97.9%, 
      and 89.8% of affirmed, negated, and suspected signs and symptoms, respectively 
      (97.6% overall accuracy). Symptom episode duration was correctly identified in 81.2% 
      of records with known duration status. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed an natural 
      language processing algorithm dubbed CHESS that achieves good performance in 
      extracting signs and symptoms from primary care free-text clinical records. In 
      addition to the presence of symptoms, our algorithm can also accurately distinguish 
      affirmed, negated, and suspected assertion statuses and extract symptom durations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Free-text imposes a challenge in health data analysis since the lack of 
      structure makes the extraction and integration of information difficult, 
      particularly in the case of massive data. An appropriate machine-interpretation of 
      electronic health records in Chile can unleash knowledge contained in large volumes 
      of clinical texts, expanding clinical management and national research capabilities. 
      AIM: To illustrate the use of a weighted frequency algorithm to find keywords. This 
      finding was carried out in the diagnostic suspicion field of the Chilean specialty 
      consultation waiting list, for diseases not covered by the Chilean Explicit Health 
      Guarantees plan. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The waiting lists for a first specialty 
      consultation for the period 2008-2018 were obtained from 17 out of 29 Chilean health 
      services, and total of 2,592,925 diagnostic suspicions were identified. A natural 
      language processing technique called Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency was 
      used for the retrieval of diagnostic suspicion keywords. RESULTS: For each 
      specialty, four key words with the highest weighted frequency were determined. Word 
      clouds showing words weighted by their importance were created to obtain a visual 
      representation. These are available at cimt.uchile.cl/lechile/. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      algorithm allowed to summarize unstructured clinical free-text data, improving its 
      usefulness and accessibility.

AB  - Documenting clinical notes in electronic health records might affect physician's 
      workflow. In this paper, an Ontology-based clinical information extraction system, 
      OB-CIE, has been developed. OB-CIE system provides a method for extracting clinical 
      concepts from physician's free-text notes and converts the unstructured clinical 
      notes to structured information to be accessed in electronic health records. OB-CIE 
      system can help physicians to document visit notes without changing their workflow. 
      For recognizing named entities of clinical concepts, ontology concepts have been 
      used to construct a dictionary of semantic categories, then, exact dictionary 
      matching method has been used to match noun phrases to their semantic categories. A 
      rule-based approach has been used to classify clinical sentences to their predefined 
      categories. The system evaluation results have achieved an F-measure of 94.90% and 
      97.80% for concepts classification and sentences classification, respectively. The 
      results have showed that OB-CIE system performed well on extracting clinical 
      concepts compared with data mining techniques. The system can be used in another 
      field by adapting its ontology and extraction rule set.

TI  - A value set for documenting adverse reactions in electronic health records.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a comprehensive value set for documenting and encoding adverse 
      reactions in the allergy module of an electronic health record. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We analyzed 2 471 004 adverse reactions stored in Partners Healthcare's 
      Enterprise-wide Allergy Repository (PEAR) of 2.7 million patients. Using the Medical 
      Text Extraction, Reasoning, and Mapping System, we processed both structured and 
      free-text reaction entries and mapped them to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine 
      - Clinical Terms. We calculated the frequencies of reaction concepts, including 
      rare, severe, and hypersensitivity reactions. We compared PEAR concepts to a Federal 
      Health Information Modeling and Standards value set and University of Nebraska 
      Medical Center data, and then created an integrated value set. RESULTS: We 
      identified 787 reaction concepts in PEAR. Frequently reported reactions included: 
      rash (14.0%), hives (8.2%), gastrointestinal irritation (5.5%), itching (3.2%), and 
      anaphylaxis (2.5%). We identified an additional 320 concepts from Federal Health 
      Information Modeling and Standards and the University of Nebraska Medical Center to 
      resolve gaps due to missing and partial matches when comparing these external 
      resources to PEAR. This yielded 1106 concepts in our final integrated value set. The 
      presence of rare, severe, and hypersensitivity reactions was limited in both 
      external datasets. Hypersensitivity reactions represented roughly 20% of the 
      reactions within our data. DISCUSSION: We developed a value set for encoding adverse 
      reactions using a large dataset from one health system, enriched by reactions from 2 
      large external resources. This integrated value set includes clinically important 
      severe and hypersensitivity reactions. CONCLUSION: This work contributes a value 
      set, harmonized with existing data, to improve the consistency and accuracy of 
      reaction documentation in electronic health records, providing the necessary 
      building blocks for more intelligent clinical decision support for allergies and 
      adverse reactions.

LID - 10.1007/s12553-020-00517-3 [doi]
AB  - General practice in the United Kingdom has been using electronic health records for 
      over two decades, but coding clinical information remains poor. Lack of interest and 
      training are considerable barriers preventing code use levels improvement. Tailored 
      training could be the way forward, to break barriers in the uptake of coding; to do 
      so it is paramount to understand coding use of the particular clinicians, to 
      recognise their needs. It should be possible to easily assess text quantity and 
      quality in medical consultations. A tool to measure these parameters, which could be 
      used to tailor training needs and assess change, is demonstrated. The tool is 
      presented and a preliminary study using a randomised sample of five recent 
      consultations from thirteen different clinicians is used as an example. The tool, 
      based on using a word processor and a spread-sheet, allowed quantitative analysis 
      among clinicians while word clouds permitted a qualitative comparison between coded 
      and free text. The average amount of free text per consultation was 68.2 words, 
      (ranging from 25.4 and 130.2 among clinicians); an average of 6% of the text was 
      coded (ranging from 0 to 13%). Patterns among clinicians could be identified. Using 
      Word cloud, a different text use was demonstrated depending on its purpose. Some 
      free text could be turned into code but nomenclature probably prevented some of the 
      codings, like the expression of time. This proof of concept demonstrated that it is 
      possible to calculate what percentage of consultations are coded and what codes are 
      used. This allowed understanding clinicians' preferences; training needs and gaps in 
      nomenclature.

AB  - The ability of caregivers and investigators to share patient data is fundamental to 
      many areas of clinical practice and biomedical research. Prior to sharing, it is 
      often necessary to remove identifiers such as names, contact details, and dates in 
      order to protect patient privacy. Deidentification, the process of removing 
      identifiers, is challenging, however. High-quality annotated data for developing 
      models is scarce; many target identifiers are highly heterogenous (for example, 
      there are uncountable variations of patient names); and in practice anything less 
      than perfect sensitivity may be considered a failure. As a result, patient data is 
      often withheld when sharing would be beneficial, and identifiable patient data is 
      often divulged when a deidentified version would suffice. In recent years, advances 
      in machine learning methods have led to rapid performance improvements in natural 
      language processing tasks, in particular with the advent of large-scale pretrained 
      language models. In this paper we develop and evaluate an approach for 
      deidentification of clinical notes based on a bidirectional transformer model. We 
      propose human interpretable evaluation measures and demonstrate state of the art 
      performance against modern baseline models. Finally, we highlight current challenges 
      in deidentification, including the absence of clear annotation guidelines, lack of 
      portability of models, and paucity of training data. Code to develop our model is 
      open source, allowing for broad reuse.

TI  - Food entries in a large allergy data repository.
PG  - e79-87
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv128 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Accurate food adverse sensitivity documentation in electronic health 
      records (EHRs) is crucial to patient safety. This study examined, encoded, and 
      grouped foods that caused any adverse sensitivity in a large allergy repository 
      using natural language processing and standard terminologies. METHODS: Using the 
      Medical Text Extraction, Reasoning, and Mapping System (MTERMS), we processed both 
      structured and free-text entries stored in an enterprise-wide allergy repository 
      (Partners' Enterprise-wide Allergy Repository), normalized diverse food allergen 
      terms into concepts, and encoded these concepts using the Systematized Nomenclature 
      of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) and Unique Ingredient Identifiers (UNII) 
      terminologies. Concept coverage also was assessed for these two terminologies. We 
      further categorized allergen concepts into groups and calculated the frequencies of 
      these concepts by group. Finally, we conducted an external validation of MTERMS's 
      performance when identifying food allergen terms, using a randomized sample from a 
      different institution. RESULTS: We identified 158 552 food allergen records (2140 
      unique terms) in the Partners repository, corresponding to 672 food allergen 
      concepts. High-frequency groups included shellfish (19.3%), fruits or vegetables 
      (18.4%), dairy (9.0%), peanuts (8.5%), tree nuts (8.5%), eggs (6.0%), grains (5.1%), 
      and additives (4.7%). Ambiguous, generic concepts such as "nuts" and "seafood" 
      accounted for 8.8% of the records. SNOMED-CT covered more concepts than UNII in 
      terms of exact (81.7% vs 68.0%) and partial (14.3% vs 9.7%) matches. DISCUSSION: 
      Adverse sensitivities to food are diverse, and existing standard terminologies have 
      gaps in their coverage of the breadth of allergy concepts. CONCLUSION: New 
      strategies are needed to represent and standardize food adverse sensitivity 
      concepts, to improve documentation in EHRs.

TI  - Extraction of Family History Information From Clinical Notes: Deep Learning and 
      Heuristics Approach.
PG  - e22898
LID - 10.2196/22898 [doi]
LID - e22898
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records store large amounts of patient clinical data. 
      Despite efforts to structure patient data, clinical notes containing rich patient 
      information remain stored as free text, greatly limiting its exploitation. This 
      includes family history, which is highly relevant for applications such as diagnosis 
      and prognosis. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop automatic strategies for 
      annotating family history information in clinical notes, focusing not only on the 
      extraction of relevant entities such as family members and disease mentions but also 
      on the extraction of relations between the identified entities. METHODS: This study 
      extends a previous contribution for the 2019 track on family history extraction from 
      national natural language processing clinical challenges by improving a previously 
      developed rule-based engine, using deep learning (DL) approaches for the extraction 
      of entities from clinical notes, and combining both approaches in a hybrid 
      end-to-end system capable of successfully extracting family member and observation 
      entities and the relations between those entities. Furthermore, this study analyzes 
      the impact of factors such as the use of external resources and different types of 
      embeddings in the performance of DL models. RESULTS: The approaches developed were 
      evaluated in a first task regarding entity extraction and in a second task 
      concerning relation extraction. The proposed DL approach improved observation 
      extraction, obtaining F(1) scores of 0.8688 and 0.7907 in the training and test 
      sets, respectively. However, DL approaches have limitations in the extraction of 
      family members. The rule-based engine was adjusted to have higher generalizing 
      capability and achieved family member extraction F(1) scores of 0.8823 and 0.8092 in 
      the training and test sets, respectively. The resulting hybrid system obtained F(1) 
      scores of 0.8743 and 0.7979 in the training and test sets, respectively. For the 
      second task, the original evaluator was adjusted to perform a more exact evaluation 
      than the original one, and the hybrid system obtained F(1) scores of 0.6480 and 
      0.5082 in the training and test sets, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated the 
      impact of several factors on the performance of DL models, and we present an 
      end-to-end system for extracting family history information from clinical notes, 
      which can help in the structuring and reuse of this type of information. The final 
      hybrid solution is provided in a publicly available code repository.

TI  - Automated outcome classification of emergency department computed tomography imaging 
      reports.
PG  - 848-54
LID - 10.1111/acem.12174 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reliably abstracting outcomes from free-text electronic health records 
      remains a challenge. While automated classification of free text has been a popular 
      medical informatics topic, performance validation using real-world clinical data has 
      been limited. The two main approaches are linguistic (natural language processing 
      [NLP]) and statistical (machine learning). The authors have developed a hybrid 
      system for abstracting computed tomography (CT) reports for specified outcomes. 
      OBJECTIVES: The objective was to measure performance of a hybrid NLP and machine 
      learning system for automated outcome classification of emergency department (ED) CT 
      imaging reports. The hypothesis was that such a system is comparable to medical 
      personnel doing the data abstraction. METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed on 
      a prior diagnostic imaging study on 3,710 blunt facial trauma victims. Staff 
      radiologists dictated CT reports as free text, which were then deidentified. A 
      trained data abstractor manually coded the reference standard outcome of acute 
      orbital fracture, with a random subset double-coded for reliability. The data set 
      was randomly split evenly into training and testing sets. Training patient reports 
      were used as input to the Medical Language Extraction and Encoding (MedLEE) NLP tool 
      to create structured output containing standardized medical terms and modifiers for 
      certainty and temporal status. Findings were filtered for low certainty and 
      past/future modifiers and then combined with the manual reference standard to 
      generate decision tree classifiers using data mining tools Waikato Environment for 
      Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) 3.7.5 and Salford Predictive Miner 6.6. Performance of 
      decision tree classifiers was evaluated on the testing set with or without NLP 
      processing. RESULTS: The performance of machine learning alone was comparable to 
      prior NLP studies (sensitivity = 0.92, specificity = 0.93, precision = 0.95, recall 
      = 0.93, f-score = 0.94), and the combined use of NLP and machine learning showed 
      further improvement (sensitivity = 0.93, specificity = 0.97, precision = 0.97, 
      recall = 0.96, f-score = 0.97). This performance is similar to, or better than, that 
      of medical personnel in previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: A hybrid NLP and machine 
      learning automated classification system shows promise in coding free-text 
      electronic clinical data.

TI  - Current approaches to identify sections within clinical narratives from electronic 
      health records: a systematic review.
PG  - 155
LID - 10.1186/s12874-019-0792-y [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification of sections in narrative content of Electronic Health 
      Records (EHR) has demonstrated to improve the performance of clinical extraction 
      tasks; however, there is not yet a shared understanding of the concept and its 
      existing methods. The objective is to report the results of a systematic review 
      concerning approaches aimed at identifying sections in narrative content of EHR, 
      using both automatic or semi-automatic methods. METHODS: This review includes 
      articles from the databases: SCOPUS, Web of Science and PubMed (from January 1994 to 
      September 2018). The selection of studies was done using predefined eligibility 
      criteria and applying the PRISMA recommendations. Search criteria were elaborated by 
      using an iterative and collaborative keyword enrichment. RESULTS: Following the 
      eligibility criteria, 39 studies were selected for analysis. The section 
      identification approaches proposed by these studies vary greatly depending on the 
      kind of narrative, the type of section, and the application. We observed that 57% of 
      them proposed formal methods for identifying sections and 43% adapted a previously 
      created method. Seventy-eight percent were intended for English texts and 41% for 
      discharge summaries. Studies that are able to identify explicit (with headings) and 
      implicit sections correspond to 46%. Regarding the level of granularity, 54% of the 
      studies are able to identify sections, but not subsections. From the technical point 
      of view, the methods can be classified into rule-based methods (59%), machine 
      learning methods (22%) and a combination of both (19%). Hybrid methods showed better 
      results than those relying on pure machine learning approaches, but lower than 
      rule-based methods; however, their scope was more ambitious than the latter ones. 
      Despite all the promising performance results, very few studies reported tests under 
      a formal setup. Almost all the studies relied on custom dictionaries; however, they 
      used them in conjunction with a controlled terminology, most commonly the UMLSⓇ 
      metathesaurus. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of sections in EHR narratives is gaining 
      popularity for improving clinical extraction projects. This study enabled the 
      community working on clinical NLP to gain a formal analysis of this task, including 
      the most successful ways to perform it.

TI  - Extraction and mapping of drug names from free text to a standardized nomenclature.
PG  - 438-42
AB  - Free text fields are often used to store clinical drug data in electronic health 
      records. The use of free text facilitates rapid data entry by the clinician. Errors 
      in spelling, abbreviations, and jargon, however, limit the utility of these data. We 
      designed and implemented an algorithm, using open source tools and RxNorm, to 
      extract and normalize drug data stored in free text fields of an anesthesia 
      electronic health record. The algorithm was developed using a training set 
      containing drug data from 49,518 cases, and validated using a validation set 
      containing data from 14,655 cases. Overall sensitivity and specificity for the 
      validation set were 92.2% and 95.7% respectively. The mains sources of error were 
      misspellings and unknown but valid drug names. These preliminary results demonstrate 
      that free text clinical drug data can be efficiently extracted and mapped to a 
      controlled drug nomenclature.

TI  - Cohort profile: St. Michael's Hospital Tuberculosis Database (SMH-TB), a 
      retrospective cohort of electronic health record data and variables extracted using 
      natural language processing.
PG  - e0247872

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of death worldwide. TB research draws 
      heavily on clinical cohorts which can be generated using electronic health records 
      (EHR), but granular information extracted from unstructured EHR data is limited. The 
      St. Michael's Hospital TB database (SMH-TB) was established to address gaps in 
      EHR-derived TB clinical cohorts and provide researchers and clinicians with 
      detailed, granular data related to TB management and treatment. METHODS: We 
      collected and validated multiple layers of EHR data from the TB outpatient clinic at 
      St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada to generate the SMH-TB database. 
      SMH-TB contains structured data directly from the EHR, and variables generated using 
      natural language processing (NLP) by extracting relevant information from free-text 
      within clinic, radiology, and other notes. NLP performance was assessed using 
      recall, precision and F1 score averaged across variable labels. We present 
      characteristics of the cohort population using binomial proportions and 95% 
      confidence intervals (CI), with and without adjusting for NLP misclassification 
      errors. RESULTS: SMH-TB currently contains retrospective patient data spanning 2011 
      to 2018, for a total of 3298 patients (N = 3237 with at least 1 associated 
      dictation). Performance of TB diagnosis and medication NLP rulesets surpasses 93% in 
      recall, precision and F1 metrics, indicating good generalizability. We estimated 20% 
      (95% CI: 18.4-21.2%) were diagnosed with active TB and 46% (95% CI: 43.8-47.2%) were 
      diagnosed with latent TB. After adjusting for potential misclassification, the 
      proportion of patients diagnosed with active and latent TB was 18% (95% CI: 
      16.8-19.7%) and 40% (95% CI: 37.8-41.6%) respectively. CONCLUSION: SMH-TB is a 
      unique database that includes a breadth of structured data derived from structured 
      and unstructured EHR data by using NLP rulesets. The data are available for a 
      variety of research applications, such as clinical epidemiology, quality improvement 
      and mathematical modeling studies.

TI  - Identifying vulnerable older adult populations by contextualizing geriatric syndrome 
      information in clinical notes of electronic health records.
PG  - 787-795
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocz093 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Geriatric syndromes such as functional disability and lack of social 
      support are often not encoded in electronic health records (EHRs), thus obscuring 
      the identification of vulnerable older adults in need of additional medical and 
      social services. In this study, we automatically identify vulnerable older adult 
      patients with geriatric syndrome based on clinical notes extracted from an EHR 
      system, and demonstrate how contextual information can improve the process. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We propose a novel end-to-end neural architecture to identify 
      sentences that contain geriatric syndromes. Our model learns a representation of the 
      sentence and augments it with contextual information: surrounding sentences, the 
      entire clinical document, and the diagnosis codes associated with the document. We 
      trained our system on annotated notes from 85 patients, tuned the model on another 
      50 patients, and evaluated its performance on the rest, 50 patients. RESULTS: 
      Contextual information improved classification, with the most effective context 
      coming from the surrounding sentences. At sentence level, our best performing model 
      achieved a micro-F1 of 0.605, significantly outperforming context-free baselines. At 
      patient level, our best model achieved a micro-F1 of 0.843. DISCUSSION: Our solution 
      can be used to expand the identification of vulnerable older adults with geriatric 
      syndromes. Since functional and social factors are often not captured by diagnosis 
      codes in EHRs, the automatic identification of the geriatric syndrome can reduce 
      disparities by ensuring consistent care across the older adult population. 
      CONCLUSION: EHR free-text can be used to identify vulnerable older adults with a 
      range of geriatric syndromes.

TI  - EHR Text Categorization for Enhanced Patient-Based Document Navigation.
PG  - 100-107
AB  - Patients with multiple disorders usually have long diagnosis lists, constitute by 
      ICD-10 codes together with individual free-text descriptions. These text snippets 
      are produced by overwriting standardized ICD-Code topics by the physicians at the 
      point of care. They provide highly compact expert descriptions within a 50-character 
      long text field frequently not assigned to a specific ICD-10 code. The high 
      redundancy of these lists would benefit from content-based categorization within 
      different hospital-based application scenarios. This work demonstrates how to 
      accurately group diagnosis lists via a combination of natural language processing 
      and hierarchical clustering with an overall F-measure value of 0.87. In addition, it 
      compresses the initial diagnosis list up to 89%. The manuscript discusses pitfall 
      and challenges as well as the potential of a large-scale approach for tackling this 
      problem.

TI  - Determining Onset for Familial Breast and Colorectal Cancer from Family History 
      Comments in the Electronic Health Record.
PG  - 173-181
AB  - Background. Family health history (FHH) can be used to identify individuals at 
      elevated risk for familial cancers. Risk criteria for common cancers rely on age of 
      onset, which is documented inconsistently as structured and unstructured data in 
      electronic health records (EHRs). Objective. To investigate a natural language 
      processing (NLP) approach to extract age of onset and age of death from free-text 
      EHR fields. Methods. Using 474,651 FHH entries from 89,814 patients, we investigated 
      two methods - frequent patterns (baseline) and NLP classifier. Results. For age of 
      onset, the NLP classifier outperformed the baseline in precision (96% vs. 83%; 95% 
      CI [94, 97] and [80, 86]) with equivalent recall (both 93%; 95% CI [91, 95]). When 
      applied to the full dataset, the NLP approach increased the percentage of FHH 
      entries for which cancer risk criteria could be applied from 10% to 15%. Conclusion. 
      NLP combined with structured data may improve the computation of familial cancer 
      risk criteria for various use cases.

TI  - Analysis of Clinical Variations in Asthma Care Documented in Electronic Health 
      Records Between Staff and Resident Physicians.
PG  - 1170-1174
AB  - Clinical documentation using free text to describe a patient's medical status is an 
      essential component of electronic health records (EHRs), and the quality of 
      information in documents plays a critical role in clinical practice and 
      translational research. Physicians are the primary creators of EHRs, but their 
      clinical practices vary substantially, resulting in variations in clinical 
      documentation. These variations can represent a source for potential bias in 
      clinical outcomes and downstream applications using EHRs. Asthma is one example, 
      presenting an inconsistent ascertainment process and criteria. A recent study 
      revealed that resident physicians' knowledge of asthma diagnosis and management is 
      relatively limited. In this study, we examined clinical documentation variations in 
      asthma care between staff and resident physicians using individual words, topics, 
      and asthma-related concepts in EHR clinical narratives. Additionally, we discuss 
      potential biases in building an informatics model and further compare asthma 
      diagnosis and outcomes between two physician groups.

TI  - Identifying Predictors of Suicide in Severe Mental Illness: A Feasibility Study of a 
      Clinical Prediction Rule (Oxford Mental Illness and Suicide Tool or OxMIS).
PG  - 268
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00268 [doi]
LID - 268
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxford Mental Illness and Suicide tool (OxMIS) is a brief, scalable, 
      freely available, structured risk assessment tool to assess suicide risk in patients 
      with severe mental illness (schizophrenia-spectrum disorders or bipolar disorder). 
      OxMIS requires further external validation, but a lack of large-scale cohorts with 
      relevant variables makes this challenging. Electronic health records provide 
      possible data sources for external validation of risk prediction tools. However, 
      they contain large amounts of information within free-text that is not readily 
      extractable. In this study, we examined the feasibility of identifying suicide 
      predictors needed to validate OxMIS in routinely collected electronic health 
      records. METHODS: In study 1, we manually reviewed electronic health records of 57 
      patients with severe mental illness to calculate OxMIS risk scores. In study 2, we 
      examined the feasibility of using natural language processing to scale up this 
      process. We used anonymized free-text documents from the Clinical Record Interactive 
      Search database to train a named entity recognition model, a machine learning 
      technique which recognizes concepts in free-text. The model identified eight 
      concepts relevant for suicide risk assessment: medication 
      (antidepressant/antipsychotic treatment), violence, education, self-harm, benefits 
      receipt, drug/alcohol use disorder, suicide, and psychiatric admission. We assessed 
      model performance in terms of precision (similar to positive predictive value), 
      recall (similar to sensitivity) and F1 statistic (an overall performance measure). 
      RESULTS: In study 1, we estimated suicide risk for all patients using the OxMIS 
      calculator, giving a range of 12 month risk estimates from 0.1-3.4%. For 13 out of 
      17 predictors, there was no missing information in electronic health records. For 
      the remaining 4 predictors missingness ranged from 7-26%; to account for these 
      missing variables, it was possible for OxMIS to estimate suicide risk using a range 
      of scores. In study 2, the named entity recognition model had an overall precision 
      of 0.77, recall of 0.90 and F1 score of 0.83. The concept with the best precision 
      and recall was medication (precision 0.84, recall 0.96) and the weakest were suicide 
      (precision 0.37), and drug/alcohol use disorder (recall 0.61). CONCLUSIONS: It is 
      feasible to estimate suicide risk with the OxMIS tool using predictors identified in 
      routine clinical records. Predictors could be extracted using natural language 
      processing. However, electronic health records differ from other data sources, 
      particularly for family history variables, which creates methodological challenges.

      free-text clinical research eligibility criteria of Alzheimer's clinical trials into 
      a structured relational database compliant with standards for medical terminologies 
      and clinical data models. We utilized a hybrid natural language processing system 
      and a concept normalization tool to extract medical terms in clinical research 
      eligibility criteria and represent them using the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) v5. 
      We created a database schema design to store syntactic relations to facilitate 
      efficient cohort queries. We further discussed the potential of applying this method 
      to trials on other diseases and the promise of using it to accelerate clinical 
      research with electronic health records.

TI  - Advanced Health Information Technologies to Engage Parents, Clinicians, and 
      Community Nutritionists in Coordinating Responsive Parenting Care: Descriptive Case 
      Series of the Women, Infants, and Children Enhancements to Early Healthy Lifestyles 
      for Baby (WEE Baby) Care Randomized Controlled Trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Socioeconomically disadvantaged newborns receive care from primary care 
      providers (PCPs) and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) nutritionists. However, care 
      is not coordinated between these settings, which can result in conflicting messages. 
      Stakeholders support an integrated approach that coordinates services between 
      settings with care tailored to patient-centered needs. OBJECTIVE: This analysis 
      describes the usability of advanced health information technologies aiming to engage 
      parents in self-reporting parenting practices, integrate data into electronic health 
      records to inform and facilitate documentation of provided responsive parenting (RP) 
      care, and share data between settings to create opportunities to coordinate care 
      between PCPs and WIC nutritionists. METHODS: Parents and newborns (dyads) who were 
      eligible for WIC care and received pediatric care in a single health system were 
      recruited and randomized to a RP intervention or control group. For the 6-month 
      intervention, electronic systems were created to facilitate documentation, data 
      sharing, and coordination of provided RP care. Prior to PCP visits, parents were 
      prompted to respond to the Early Healthy Lifestyles (EHL) self-assessment tool to 
      capture current RP practices. Responses were integrated into the electronic health 
      record and shared with WIC. Documentation of RP care and an 80-character, free-text 
      comment were shared between WIC and PCPs. A care coordination opportunity existed 
      when the dyad attended a WIC visit and these data were available from the PCP, and 
      vice versa. Care coordination was demonstrated when WIC or PCPs interacted with data 
      and documented RP care provided at the visit. RESULTS: Dyads (N=131) attended 459 
      PCP (3.5, SD 1.0 per dyad) and 296 WIC (2.3, SD 1.0 per dyad) visits. Parents 
      completed the EHL tool prior to 53.2% (244/459) of PCP visits (1.9, SD 1.2 per 
      dyad), PCPs documented provided RP care at 35.3% (162/459) of visits, and data were 
      shared with WIC following 100% (459/459) of PCP visits. A WIC visit followed a PCP 
      visit 50.3% (231/459) of the time; thus, there were 1.8 (SD 0.8 per dyad) PCP to WIC 
      care coordination opportunities. WIC coordinated care by documenting RP care at 
      66.7% (154/231) of opportunities (1.2, SD 0.9 per dyad). WIC visits were followed by 
      a PCP visit 58.9% (116/197) of the time; thus, there were 0.9 (SD 0.8 per dyad) WIC 
      to PCP care coordination opportunities. PCPs coordinated care by documenting RP care 
      at 44.0% (51/116) of opportunities (0.4, SD 0.6 per dyad). CONCLUSIONS: Results 
      support the usability of advanced health information technology strategies to 
      collect patient-reported data and share these data between multiple providers. 
      Although PCPs and WIC shared data, WIC nutritionists were more likely to use data 
      and document RP care to coordinate care than PCPs. Variability in timing, sequence, 
      and frequency of visits underscores the need for flexibility in pragmatic studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The radiology report is the most important source of clinical imaging 
      information. It documents critical information about the patient's health and the 
      radiologist's interpretation of medical findings. It also communicates information 
      to the referring physicians and records that information for future clinical and 
      research use. Although efforts to structure some radiology report information 
      through predefined templates are beginning to bear fruit, a large portion of 
      radiology report information is entered in free text. The free text format is a 
      major obstacle for rapid extraction and subsequent use of information by clinicians, 
      researchers, and healthcare information systems. This difficulty is due to the 
      ambiguity and subtlety of natural language, complexity of described images, and 
      variations among different radiologists and healthcare organizations. As a result, 
      radiology reports are used only once by the clinician who ordered the study and 
      rarely are used again for research and data mining. In this work, machine learning 
      techniques and a large multi-institutional radiology report repository are used to 
      extract the semantics of the radiology report and overcome the barriers to the 
      re-use of radiology report information in clinical research and other healthcare 
      applications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We describe a machine learning system to 
      annotate radiology reports and extract report contents according to an information 
      model. This information model covers the majority of clinically significant contents 
      in radiology reports and is applicable to a wide variety of radiology study types. 
      Our automated approach uses discriminative sequence classifiers for named-entity 
      recognition to extract and organize clinically significant terms and phrases 
      consistent with the information model. We evaluated our information extraction 
      system on 150 radiology reports from three major healthcare organizations and 
      compared its results to a commonly used non-machine learning information extraction 
      method. We also evaluated the generalizability of our approach across different 
      organizations by training and testing our system on data from different 
      organizations. RESULTS: Our results show the efficacy of our machine learning 
      approach in extracting the information model's elements (10-fold cross-validation 
      average performance: precision: 87%, recall: 84%, F1 score: 85%) and its superiority 
      and generalizability compared to the common non-machine learning approach 
      (p-value<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning information extraction approach 
      provides an effective automatic method to annotate and extract clinically 
      significant information from a large collection of free text radiology reports. This 
      information extraction system can help clinicians better understand the radiology 
      reports and prioritize their review process. In addition, the extracted information 
      can be used by researchers to link radiology reports to information from other data 
      sources such as electronic health records and the patient's genome. Extracted 
      information also can facilitate disease surveillance, real-time clinical decision 
      support for the radiologist, and content-based image retrieval.

AB  - Research into suicide prevention has been hampered by methodological limitations 
      such as low sample size and recall bias. Recently, Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
      strategies have been used with Electronic Health Records to increase information 
      extraction from free text notes as well as structured fields concerning suicidality 
      and this allows access to much larger cohorts than previously possible. This paper 
      presents two novel NLP approaches - a rule-based approach to classify the presence 
      of suicide ideation and a hybrid machine learning and rule-based approach to 
      identify suicide attempts in a psychiatric clinical database. Good performance of 
      the two classifiers in the evaluation study suggest they can be used to accurately 
      detect mentions of suicide ideation and attempt within free-text documents in this 
      psychiatric database. The novelty of the two approaches lies in the malleability of 
      each classifier if a need to refine performance, or meet alternate classification 
      requirements arises. The algorithms can also be adapted to fit infrastructures of 
      other clinical datasets given sufficient clinical recording practice knowledge, 
      without dependency on medical codes or additional data extraction of known risk 
      factors to predict suicidal behaviour.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs) have potential to facilitate reliable 
      communication and follow-up of test results. However, limitations in EHR 
      functionality remain, leading practitioners to use workarounds while managing test 
      results. Workarounds can lead to patient safety concerns and signify indications as 
      to how to build better EHR systems that meet provider needs. OBJECTIVE: To 
      understand why primary care practitioners (PCPs) use workarounds to manage test 
      results by analyzing data from a previously conducted national cross-sectional 
      survey on test result management. METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis of 
      quantitative and qualitative data from a national survey of PCPs practicing in the 
      Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and explored the use of workarounds in test 
      results management. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to examine the 
      association between key sociotechnical factors that could affect test results 
      follow-up (e.g., both technology-related and those unrelated to technology, such as 
      organizational support for patient notification) and workaround use. We conducted a 
      qualitative content analysis of free text survey data to examine reasons for use of 
      workarounds. RESULTS: Of 2554 survey respondents, 1104 (43%) reported using 
      workarounds related to test results management. Of these 1028 (93%) described the 
      type of workaround they were using; 719 (70%) reported paper-based methods, while 
      230 (22%) used a combination of paper- and computer-based workarounds. Primary care 
      practitioners who self-reported limited administrative support to help them notify 
      patients of test results or described an instance where they personally (or a 
      colleague) missed results, were more likely to use workarounds (p=0.02 and p=0.001, 
      respectively). Qualitative analysis identified three main reasons for workaround 
      use: 1) as a memory aid, 2) for improved efficiency and 3) for facilitating internal 
      and external care coordination. CONCLUSION: Workarounds to manage EHR-based test 
      results are common, and their use results from unmet provider information management 
      needs. Future EHRs and the respective work systems around them need to evolve to 
      meet these needs.

TI  - Measuring the Value of a Practical Text Mining Approach to Identify Patients With 
      Housing Issues in the Free-Text Notes in Electronic Health Record: Findings of a 
      Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 697501
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2021.697501 [doi]
LID - 697501
AB  - Introduction: Despite the growing efforts to standardize coding for social 
      determinants of health (SDOH), they are infrequently captured in electronic health 
      records (EHRs). Most SDOH variables are still captured in the unstructured fields 
      (i.e., free-text) of EHRs. In this study we attempt to evaluate a practical text 
      mining approach (i.e., advanced pattern matching techniques) in identifying phrases 
      referring to housing issues, an important SDOH domain affecting value-based 
      healthcare providers, using EHR of a large multispecialty medical group in the New 
      England region, United States. To present how this approach would help the health 
      systems to address the SDOH challenges of their patients we assess the demographic 
      and clinical characteristics of patients with and without housing issues and briefly 
      look into the patterns of healthcare utilization among the study population and for 
      those with and without housing challenges. Methods: We identified five categories of 
      housing issues [i.e., homelessness current (HC), homelessness history (HH), 
      homelessness addressed (HA), housing instability (HI), and building quality (BQ)] 
      and developed several phrases addressing each one through collaboration with SDOH 
      experts, consulting the literature, and reviewing existing coding standards. We 
      developed pattern-matching algorithms (i.e., advanced regular expressions), and then 
      applied them in the selected EHR. We assessed the text mining approach for recall 
      (sensitivity) and precision (positive predictive value) after comparing the 
      identified phrases with manually annotated free-text for different housing issues. 
      Results: The study dataset included EHR structured data for a total of 20,342 
      patients and 2,564,344 free-text clinical notes. The mean (SD) age in the study 
      population was 75.96 (7.51). Additionally, 58.78% of the cohort were female. BQ and 
      HI were the most frequent housing issues documented in EHR free-text notes and HH 
      was the least frequent one. The regular expression methodology, when compared to 
      manual annotation, had a high level of precision (positive predictive value) at 
      phrase, note, and patient levels (96.36, 95.00, and 94.44%, respectively) across 
      different categories of housing issues, but the recall (sensitivity) rate was 
      relatively low (30.11, 32.20, and 41.46%, respectively). Conclusion: Results of this 
      study can be used to advance the research in this domain, to assess the potential 
      value of EHR's free-text in identifying patients with a high risk of housing issues, 
      to improve patient care and outcomes, and to eventually mitigate socioeconomic 
      disparities across individuals and communities.

TI  - Case-based reasoning using electronic health records efficiently identifies eligible 
      patients for clinical trials.
PG  - e141-50
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocu050 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a cost-effective, case-based reasoning framework for clinical 
      research eligibility screening by only reusing the electronic health records (EHRs) 
      of minimal enrolled participants to represent the target patient for each trial 
      under consideration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The EHR data--specifically diagnosis, 
      medications, laboratory results, and clinical notes--of known clinical trial 
      participants were aggregated to profile the "target patient" for a trial, which was 
      used to discover new eligible patients for that trial. The EHR data of unseen 
      patients were matched to this "target patient" to determine their relevance to the 
      trial; the higher the relevance, the more likely the patient was eligible. Relevance 
      scores were a weighted linear combination of cosine similarities computed over 
      individual EHR data types. For evaluation, we identified 262 participants of 13 
      diversified clinical trials conducted at Columbia University as our gold standard. 
      We ran a 2-fold cross validation with half of the participants used for training and 
      the other half used for testing along with other 30 000 patients selected at random 
      from our clinical database. We performed binary classification and ranking 
      experiments. RESULTS: The overall area under the ROC curve for classification was 
      0.95, enabling the highlight of eligible patients with good precision. Ranking 
      showed satisfactory results especially at the top of the recommended list, with each 
      trial having at least one eligible patient in the top five positions. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This relevance-based method can potentially be used to identify eligible patients 
      for clinical trials by processing patient EHR data alone without parsing free-text 
      eligibility criteria, and shows promise of efficient "case-based reasoning" modeled 
      only on minimal trial participants.

TI  - Identifying Acute Low Back Pain Episodes in Primary Care Practice From Clinical 
      Notes: Observational Study.
PG  - e16878
LID - 10.2196/16878 [doi]
LID - e16878
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) are different conditions with 
      different treatments. However, they are coded in electronic health records with the 
      same International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) code (M54.5) 
      and can be differentiated only by retrospective chart reviews. This prevents an 
      efficient definition of data-driven guidelines for billing and therapy 
      recommendations, such as return-to-work options. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this 
      study was to evaluate the feasibility of automatically distinguishing acute LBP 
      episodes by analyzing free-text clinical notes. METHODS: We used a dataset of 17,409 
      clinical notes from different primary care practices; of these, 891 documents were 
      manually annotated as acute LBP and 2973 were generally associated with LBP via the 
      recorded ICD-10 code. We compared different supervised and unsupervised strategies 
      for automated identification: keyword search, topic modeling, logistic regression 
      with bag of n-grams and manual features, and deep learning (a convolutional neural 
      network-based architecture [ConvNet]). We trained the supervised models using either 
      manual annotations or ICD-10 codes as positive labels. RESULTS: ConvNet trained 
      using manual annotations obtained the best results with an area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve of 0.98 and an F score of 0.70. ConvNet's results 
      were also robust to reduction of the number of manually annotated documents. In the 
      absence of manual annotations, topic models performed better than methods trained 
      using ICD-10 codes, which were unsatisfactory for identifying LBP acuity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study uses clinical notes to delineate a potential path toward 
      systematic learning of therapeutic strategies, billing guidelines, and management 
      options for acute LBP at the point of care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The penicillin adverse drug reaction (ADR) label is common in electronic 
      health records (EHRs). However, there is significant misclassification between 
      allergy and intolerance within the EHR and most patients can be delabelled after an 
      immunologic assessment. Machine learning natural language processing may be able to 
      assist with the categorisation and risk stratification of penicillin ADRs. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use text entered into an EHR to derive and 
      evaluate machine learning models to classify penicillin ADRs and assess the risk of 
      true allergy. METHODS: Machine learning natural language processing was applied to 
      free-text penicillin ADR data extracted from a public health system EHR. The model 
      was developed by training on labelled dataset. ADR entries were split into training 
      and testing datasets and used to develop and test a variety of machine learning 
      models. These were compared to categorisation with a simple algorithm using keyword 
      search. RESULTS: The best performing model for the classification of penicillin ADRs 
      as being consistent with allergy or intolerance was the artificial neural network 
      (AUC 0.994, sensitivity 0.99, specificity 0.96). The artificial neural network also 
      achieved the highest AUC in the classification of high- or low-risk of true allergy 
      (AUC 0.988, sensitivity 0.99, specificity 0.99). All ADR labels were able to be 
      classified using these machine learning models, whereas a small proportion were 
      unclassifiable using the simple algorithm as they contained no keywords. CONCLUSION: 
      Machine learning natural language processing performed similarly to expert criteria 
      in classifying and risk stratifying penicillin ADRs labels. These models 
      outperformed simpler algorithms in their ability to interpret free-text data 
      contained in the EHR. The automated evaluation of penicillin ADR labels may allow 
      real-time risk stratification to facilitate delabelling and improve the specificity 
      of prescribing alerts.

TI  - Methodological Issues in Predicting Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery Candidates Through 
      Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
PG  - 11-8
LID - 10.4137/BII.S38308 [doi]
AB  - We describe the development and evaluation of a system that uses machine learning 
      and natural language processing techniques to identify potential candidates for 
      surgical intervention for drug-resistant pediatric epilepsy. The data are comprised 
      of free-text clinical notes extracted from the electronic health record (EHR). Both 
      known clinical outcomes from the EHR and manual chart annotations provide gold 
      standards for the patient's status. The following hypotheses are then tested: 1) 
      machine learning methods can identify epilepsy surgery candidates as well as 
      physicians do and 2) machine learning methods can identify candidates earlier than 
      physicians do. These hypotheses are tested by systematically evaluating the effects 
      of the data source, amount of training data, class balance, classification 
      algorithm, and feature set on classifier performance. The results support both 
      hypotheses, with F-measures ranging from 0.71 to 0.82. The feature set, 
      classification algorithm, amount of training data, class balance, and gold standard 
      all significantly affected classification performance. It was further observed that 
      classification performance was better than the highest agreement between two 
      annotators, even at one year before documented surgery referral. The results 
      demonstrate that such machine learning methods can contribute to predicting 
      pediatric epilepsy surgery candidates and reducing lag time to surgery referral.

TI  - The Revival of the Notes Field: Leveraging the Unstructured Content in Electronic 
      Health Records.
PG  - 66

LID - 66
AB  - Problem: Clinical practice requires the production of a time- and resource-consuming 
      great amount of notes. They contain relevant information, but their secondary use is 
      almost impossible, due to their unstructured nature. Researchers are trying to 
      address this problems, with traditional and promising novel techniques. Application 
      in real hospital settings seems not to be possible yet, though, both because of 
      relatively small and dirty dataset, and for the lack of language-specific 
      pre-trained models. Aim: Our aim is to demonstrate the potential of the above 
      techniques, but also raise awareness of the still open challenges that the 
      scientific communities of IT and medical practitioners must jointly address to 
      realize the full potential of unstructured content that is daily produced and 
      digitized in hospital settings, both to improve its data quality and leverage the 
      insights from data-driven predictive models. Methods: To this extent, we present a 
      narrative literature review of the most recent and relevant contributions to 
      leverage the application of Natural Language Processing techniques to the free-text 
      content electronic patient records. In particular, we focused on four selected 
      application domains, namely: data quality, information extraction, sentiment 
      analysis and predictive models, and automated patient cohort selection. Then, we 
      will present a few empirical studies that we undertook at a major teaching hospital 
      specializing in musculoskeletal diseases. Results: We provide the reader with some 
      simple and affordable pipelines, which demonstrate the feasibility of reaching 
      literature performance levels with a single institution non-English dataset. In such 
      a way, we bridged literature and real world needs, performing a step further toward 
      the revival of notes fields.

TI  - Natural Language Processing Enhances Prediction of Functional Outcome After Acute 
      Ischemic Stroke.
PG  - e023486
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.023486 [doi]
AB  - Background Conventional prognostic scores usually require predefined clinical 
      variables to predict outcome. The advancement of natural language processing has 
      made it feasible to derive meaning from unstructured data. We aimed to test whether 
      using unstructured text in electronic health records can improve the prediction of 
      functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke. Methods and Results Patients 
      hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke were identified from 2 hospital stroke 
      registries (3847 and 2668 patients, respectively). Prediction models developed using 
      the first cohort were externally validated using the second cohort, and vice versa. 
      Free text in the history of present illness and computed tomography reports was used 
      to build machine learning models using natural language processing to predict poor 
      functional outcome at 90 days poststroke. Four conventional prognostic models were 
      used as baseline models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves 
      of the model using history of present illness in the internal and external 
      validation sets were 0.820 and 0.792, respectively, which were comparable to the 
      National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (0.811 and 0.807). The model using 
      computed tomography reports achieved area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curves of 0.758 and 0.658. Adding information from clinical text 
      significantly improved the predictive performance of each baseline model in terms of 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curves, net reclassification 
      improvement, and integrated discrimination improvement indices (all P<0.001). 
      Swapping the study cohorts led to similar results. Conclusions By using natural 
      language processing, unstructured text in electronic health records can provide an 
      alternative tool for stroke prognostication, and even enhance the performance of 
      existing prognostic scores.

TI  - The Value of Unstructured Electronic Health Record Data in Geriatric Syndrome Case 
      Identification.
PG  - 1499-1507
LID - 10.1111/jgs.15411 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the value of unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data 
      (free-text notes) in identifying a set of geriatric syndromes. DESIGN: Retrospective 
      analysis of unstructured EHR notes using a natural language processing (NLP) 
      algorithm. SETTING: Large multispecialty group. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults 
      (N=18,341; average age 75.9, 58.9% female). MEASUREMENTS: We compared the number of 
      geriatric syndrome cases identified using structured claims and structured and 
      unstructured EHR data. We also calculated these rates using a population-level 
      claims database as a reference and identified comparable epidemiological rates in 
      peer-reviewed literature as a benchmark. RESULTS: Using insurance claims data 
      resulted in a geriatric syndrome prevalence ranging from 0.03% for lack of social 
      support to 8.3% for walking difficulty. Using structured EHR data resulted in 
      similar prevalence rates, ranging from 0.03% for malnutrition to 7.85% for walking 
      difficulty. Incorporating unstructured EHR notes, enabled by applying the NLP 
      algorithm, identified considerably higher rates of geriatric syndromes: absence of 
      fecal control (2.1%, 2.3 times as much as structured claims and EHR data combined), 
      decubitus ulcer (1.4%, 1.7 times as much), dementia (6.7%, 1.5 times as much), falls 
      (23.6%, 3.2 times as much), malnutrition (2.5%, 18.0 times as much), lack of social 
      support (29.8%, 455.9 times as much), urinary retention (4.2%, 3.9 times as much), 
      vision impairment (6.2%, 7.4 times as much), weight loss (19.2%, 2.9 as much), and 
      walking difficulty (36.34%, 3.4 as much). The geriatric syndrome rates extracted 
      from structured data were substantially lower than published epidemiological rates, 
      although adding the NLP results considerably closed this gap. CONCLUSION: Claims and 
      structured EHR data give an incomplete picture of burden related to geriatric 
      syndromes. Geriatric syndromes are likely to be missed if unstructured data are not 
      analyzed. Pragmatic NLP algorithms can assist with identifying individuals at high 
      risk of experiencing geriatric syndromes and improving coordination of care for 
      older adults.

AB  - Routine patient data in electronic patient records are only partly structured, and 
      an even smaller segment is coded, mainly for administrative purposes. Large parts 
      are only available as free text. Transforming this content into a structured and 
      semantically explicit form is a prerequisite for querying and information 
      extraction. The core of the system architecture presented in this paper is based on 
      SAP HANA in-memory database technology using the SAP Connected Health platform for 
      data integration as well as for clinical data warehousing. A natural language 
      processing pipeline analyses unstructured content and maps it to a standardized 
      vocabulary within a well-defined information model. The resulting semantically 
      standardized patient profiles are used for a broad range of clinical and research 
      application scenarios.

TI  - Extracting Clinical Features From Dictated Ambulatory Consult Notes Using a 
      Commercially Available Natural Language Processing Tool: Pilot, Retrospective, 
      Cross-Sectional Validation Study.
PG  - e12575
LID - 10.2196/12575 [doi]
LID - e12575
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) in clinical 
      practice holds the promise of improving care and advancing research by serving as a 
      rich source of data, but most EHRs allow clinicians to enter data in a text format 
      without much structure. Natural language processing (NLP) may reduce reliance on 
      manual abstraction of these text data by extracting clinical features directly from 
      unstructured clinical digital text data and converting them into structured data. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the performance of a commercially available 
      NLP tool for extracting clinical features from free-text consult notes. METHODS: We 
      conducted a pilot, retrospective, cross-sectional study of the accuracy of NLP from 
      dictated consult notes from our tuberculosis clinic with manual chart abstraction as 
      the reference standard. Consult notes for 130 patients were extracted and processed 
      using NLP. We extracted 15 clinical features from these consult notes and grouped 
      them a priori into categories of simple, moderate, and complex for analysis. 
      RESULTS: For the primary outcome of overall accuracy, NLP performed best for 
      features classified as simple, achieving an overall accuracy of 96% (95% CI 
      94.3-97.6). Performance was slightly lower for features of moderate clinical and 
      linguistic complexity at 93% (95% CI 91.1-94.4), and lowest for complex features at 
      91% (95% CI 87.3-93.1). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study support the use of 
      NLP for extracting clinical features from dictated consult notes in the setting of a 
      tuberculosis clinic. Further research is needed to fully establish the validity of 
      NLP for this and other purposes.

TI  - Importance of multi-modal approaches to effectively identify cataract cases from 
      electronic health records.
PG  - 225-34
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000456 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is increasing interest in using electronic health records (EHRs) to 
      identify subjects for genomic association studies, due in part to the availability 
      of large amounts of clinical data and the expected cost efficiencies of subject 
      identification. We describe the construction and validation of an EHR-based 
      algorithm to identify subjects with age-related cataracts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      used a multi-modal strategy consisting of structured database querying, natural 
      language processing on free-text documents, and optical character recognition on 
      scanned clinical images to identify cataract subjects and related cataract 
      attributes. Extensive validation on 3657 subjects compared the multi-modal results 
      to manual chart review. The algorithm was also implemented at participating 
      electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) institutions. RESULTS: An EHR-based 
      cataract phenotyping algorithm was successfully developed and validated, resulting 
      in positive predictive values (PPVs) >95%. The multi-modal approach increased the 
      identification of cataract subject attributes by a factor of three compared to 
      single-mode approaches while maintaining high PPV. Components of the cataract 
      algorithm were successfully deployed at three other institutions with similar 
      accuracy. DISCUSSION: A multi-modal strategy incorporating optical character 
      recognition and natural language processing may increase the number of cases 
      identified while maintaining similar PPVs. Such algorithms, however, require that 
      the needed information be embedded within clinical documents. CONCLUSION: We have 
      demonstrated that algorithms to identify and characterize cataracts can be developed 
      utilizing data collected via the EHR. These algorithms provide a high level of 
      accuracy even when implemented across multiple EHRs and institutional boundaries.

TI  - Handwork vs machine: a comparison of rheumatoid arthritis patient populations as 
      identified from EHR free-text by diagnosis extraction through machine-learning or 
      traditional criteria-based chart review.
PG  - 174

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs) offer a wealth of observational data. 
      Machine-learning (ML) methods are efficient at data extraction, capable of 
      processing the information-rich free-text physician notes in EHRs. The clinical 
      diagnosis contained therein represents physician expert opinion and is more 
      consistently recorded than classification criteria components. OBJECTIVES: To 
      investigate the overlap and differences between rheumatoid arthritis patients as 
      identified either from EHR free-text through the extraction of the rheumatologist 
      diagnosis using machine-learning (ML) or through manual chart-review applying the 
      1987 and 2010 RA classification criteria. METHODS: Since EHR initiation, 17,662 
      patients have visited the Leiden rheumatology outpatient clinic. For ML, we used a 
      support vector machine (SVM) model to identify those who were diagnosed with RA by 
      their rheumatologist. We trained and validated the model on a random selection of 
      2000 patients, balancing PPV and sensitivity to define a cutoff, and assessed 
      performance on a separate 1000 patients. We then deployed the model on our entire 
      patient selection (including the 3000). Of those, 1127 patients had both a 1987 and 
      2010 EULAR/ACR criteria status at 1 year after inclusion into the local prospective 
      arthritis cohort. In these 1127 patients, we compared the patient characteristics of 
      RA cases identified with ML and those fulfilling the classification criteria. 
      RESULTS: The ML model performed very well in the independent test set 
      (sensitivity=0.85, specificity=0.99, PPV=0.86, NPV=0.99). In our selection of 
      patients with both EHR and classification information, 373 were recognized as RA by 
      ML and 357 and 426 fulfilled the 1987 or 2010 criteria, respectively. Eighty percent 
      of the ML-identified cases fulfilled at least one of the criteria sets. Both 
      demographic and clinical parameters did not differ between the ML extracted cases 
      and those identified with EULAR/ACR classification criteria. CONCLUSIONS: With ML 
      methods, we enable fast patient extraction from the huge EHR resource. Our ML 
      algorithm accurately identifies patients diagnosed with RA by their rheumatologist. 
      This resulting group of RA patients had a strong overlap with patients identified 
      using the 1987 or 2010 classification criteria and the baseline (disease) 
      characteristics were comparable. ML-assisted case labeling enables high-throughput 
      creation of inclusive patient selections for research purposes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The secondary use of electronic health records (EHRs) promises to 
      facilitate medical research. We reviewed general data requirements in observational 
      studies and analyzed the feasibility of conducting observational studies with 
      structured EHR data, in particular diagnosis and procedure codes. METHODS: After 
      reviewing published observational studies from the University Hospital of Erlangen 
      for general data requirements, we identified three different study populations for 
      the feasibility analysis with eligibility criteria from three exemplary 
      observational studies. For each study population, we evaluated the availability of 
      relevant patient characteristics in our EHR, including outcome and exposure 
      variables. To assess data quality, we computed distributions of relevant patient 
      characteristics from the available structured EHR data and compared them to those of 
      the original studies. We implemented computed phenotypes for patient characteristics 
      where necessary. In random samples, we evaluated how well structured patient 
      characteristics agreed with a gold standard from manually interpreted free texts. We 
      categorized our findings using the four data quality dimensions "completeness", 
      "correctness", "currency" and "granularity". RESULTS: Reviewing general data 
      requirements, we found that some investigators supplement routine data with 
      questionnaires, interviews and follow-up examinations. We included 847 subjects in 
      the feasibility analysis (Study 1 n = 411, Study 2 n = 423, Study 3 n = 13). All 
      eligibility criteria from two studies were available in structured data, while one 
      study required computed phenotypes in eligibility criteria. In one study, we found 
      that all necessary patient characteristics were documented at least once in either 
      structured or unstructured data. In another study, all exposure and outcome 
      variables were available in structured data, while in the other one unstructured 
      data had to be consulted. The comparison of patient characteristics distributions, 
      as computed from structured data, with those from the original study yielded similar 
      distributions as well as indications of underreporting. We observed violations in 
      all four data quality dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: While we found relevant patient 
      characteristics available in structured EHR data, data quality problems may entail 
      that it remains a case-by-case decision whether diagnosis and procedure codes are 
      sufficient to underpin observational studies. Free-text data or subsequently 
      supplementary study data may be important to complement a comprehensive patient 
      history.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A major source of information available in electronic health record (EHR) 
      systems are the clinical free text notes documenting patient care. Managing this 
      information is time-consuming for clinicians. Automatic text summarisation could 
      assist clinicians in obtaining an overview of the free text information in ongoing 
      care episodes, as well as in writing final discharge summaries. We present a study 
      of automated text summarisation of clinical notes. It looks to identify which 
      methods are best suited for this task and whether it is possible to automatically 
      evaluate the quality differences of summaries produced by different methods in an 
      efficient and reliable way. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study is based on material 
      consisting of 66,884 care episodes from EHRs of heart patients admitted to a 
      university hospital in Finland between 2005 and 2009. We present novel extractive 
      text summarisation methods for summarising the free text content of care episodes. 
      Most of these methods rely on word space models constructed using distributional 
      semantic modelling. The summarisation effectiveness is evaluated using an 
      experimental automatic evaluation approach incorporating well-known ROUGE measures. 
      We also developed a manual evaluation scheme to perform a meta-evaluation on the 
      ROUGE measures to see if they reflect the opinions of health care professionals. 
      RESULTS: The agreement between the human evaluators is good (ICC=0.74, p<0.001), 
      demonstrating the stability of the proposed manual evaluation method. Furthermore, 
      the correlation between the manual and automated evaluations are high (> 0.90 
      Spearman's rho). Three of the presented summarisation methods ('Composite', 
      'Case-Based' and 'Translate') significantly outperform the other methods for all 
      ROUGE measures (p<0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Bonferroni correction). 
      CONCLUSION: The results indicate the feasibility of the automated summarisation of 
      care episodes. Moreover, the high correlation between manual and automated 
      evaluations suggests that the less labour-intensive automated evaluations can be 
      used as a proxy for human evaluations when developing summarisation methods. This is 
      of significant practical value for summarisation method development, because manual 
      evaluation cannot be afforded for every variation of the summarisation methods. 
      Instead, one can resort to automatic evaluation during the method development 
      process.

TI  - Optimising the use of electronic health records to estimate the incidence of 
      rheumatoid arthritis in primary care: what information is hidden in free text?
PG  - 105
LID - 10.1186/1471-2288-13-105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary care databases are a major source of data for epidemiological 
      and health services research. However, most studies are based on coded information, 
      ignoring information stored in free text. Using the early presentation of rheumatoid 
      arthritis (RA) as an exemplar, our objective was to estimate the extent of data 
      hidden within free text, using a keyword search. METHODS: We examined the electronic 
      health records (EHRs) of 6,387 patients from the UK, aged 30 years and older, with a 
      first coded diagnosis of RA between 2005 and 2008. We listed indicators for RA which 
      were present in coded format and ran keyword searches for similar information held 
      in free text. The frequency of indicator code groups and keywords from one year 
      before to 14 days after RA diagnosis were compared, and temporal relationships 
      examined. RESULTS: One or more keyword for RA was found in the free text in 29% of 
      patients prior to the RA diagnostic code. Keywords for inflammatory arthritis 
      diagnoses were present for 14% of patients whereas only 11% had a diagnostic code. 
      Codes for synovitis were found in 3% of patients, but keywords were identified in an 
      additional 17%. In 13% of patients there was evidence of a positive rheumatoid 
      factor test in text only, uncoded. No gender differences were found. Keywords 
      generally occurred close in time to the coded diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. 
      They were often found under codes indicating letters and communications. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Potential cases may be missed or wrongly dated when coded data alone 
      are used to identify patients with RA, as diagnostic suspicions are frequently 
      confined to text. The use of EHRs to create disease registers or assess quality of 
      care will be misleading if free text information is not taken into account. Methods 
      to facilitate the automated processing of text need to be developed and implemented.

TI  - Automated SNOMED CT concept and attribute relationship detection through a web-based 
      implementation of cTAKES.
PG  - 14
LID - 10.1186/s13326-019-0207-3 [doi]
LID - 14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information in Electronic Health Records is largely stored as 
      unstructured free text. Natural language processing (NLP), or Medical Language 
      Processing (MLP) in medicine, aims at extracting structured information from free 
      text, and is less expensive and time-consuming than manual extraction. However, most 
      algorithms in MLP are institution-specific or address only one clinical need, and 
      thus cannot be broadly applied. In addition, most MLP systems do not detect concepts 
      in misspelled text and cannot detect attribute relationships between concepts. The 
      objective of this study was to develop and evaluate an MLP application that includes 
      generic algorithms for the detection of (misspelled) concepts and of attribute 
      relationships between them. METHODS: An implementation of the MLP system cTAKES, 
      called DIRECT, was developed with generic SNOMED CT concept filter, concept 
      relationship detection, and attribute relationship detection algorithms and a custom 
      dictionary. Four implementations of cTAKES were evaluated by comparing 98 manually 
      annotated oncology charts with the output of DIRECT. The F(1)-score was determined 
      for named-entity recognition and attribute relationship detection for the concepts 
      'lung cancer', 'non-small cell lung cancer', and 'recurrence'. The performance of 
      the four implementations was compared with a two-tailed permutation test. RESULTS: 
      DIRECT detected lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer concepts with F(1)-scores 
      between 0.828 and 0.947 and between 0.862 and 0.933, respectively. The concept 
      recurrence was detected with a significantly higher F(1)-score of 0.921, compared to 
      the other implementations, and the relationship between recurrence and lung cancer 
      with an F(1)-score of 0.857. The precision of the detection of lung cancer, 
      non-small cell lung cancer, and recurrence concepts were 1.000, 0.966, and 0.879, 
      compared to precisions of 0.943, 0.967, and 0.000 in the original implementation, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: DIRECT can detect oncology concepts and attribute 
      relationships with high precision and can detect recurrence with significant 
      increase in F(1)-score, compared to the original implementation of cTAKES, due to 
      the usage of a custom dictionary and a generic concept relationship detection 
      algorithm. These concepts and relationships can be used to encode clinical 
      narratives, and can thus substantially reduce manual chart abstraction efforts, 
      saving time for clinicians and researchers.

TI  - Development and internal validation of a risk prediction model for falls among older 
      people using primary care electronic health records.
LID - glab311 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glab311 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently used prediction tools have limited ability to identify 
      community-dwelling older people at high risk for falls. Prediction models utilizing 
      Electronic Heath Records (EHR) provide opportunities but up to now showed limited 
      clinical value as risk stratification tool; because of among others the 
      underestimation of falls prevalence. The aim of this study was to develop a fall 
      prediction model for community-dwelling older people using a combination of 
      structured data and free text of primary care EHR and to internally validate its 
      predictive performance. METHODS: EHR data of individuals aged 65 or over. Age, sex, 
      history of falls, medications and medical conditions were included as potential 
      predictors. Falls were ascertained from the free text. We employed the 
      Bootstrap-enhanced penalized logistic regression with the least absolute shrinkage 
      and selection operator to develop the prediction model. We used 10-fold 
      cross-validation to internally validate the prediction strategy. Model performance 
      was assessed in terms of discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: Data of 36,470 
      eligible participants were extracted from the dataset. The number of participants 
      who fell at least once was 4,778 (13.1%). The final prediction model included age, 
      sex, history of falls, two medications and five medical conditions. The model had a 
      median area under the receiver operating curve of 0.705 (IQR 0.700-0.714) . 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our prediction model to identify older people at high risk for falls 
      achieved fair discrimination, and had reasonable calibration. It can be applied in 
      clinical practice as it relies on routinely collected variables and does not require 
      mobility assessment tests.

TI  - Documentation and review of social determinants of health data in the EHR: measures 
      and associated insights.
LID - ocab194 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab194 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) increasingly include designated fields 
      to capture social determinants of health (SDOH). We developed measures to 
      characterize their use, and use of other SDOH data types, to optimize SDOH data 
      integration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed 3 measures that accommodate 
      different EHR data types on an encounter or patient-year basis. We implemented these 
      measures-documented during encounter (DDE) captures documentation occurring during 
      the encounter; documented by discharge (DBD) includes DDE plus documentation 
      occurring any time prior to admission; and reviewed during encounter (RDE) captures 
      whether anyone reviewed documented data-for the newly available structured SDOH 
      fields and 4 other comparator SDOH data types (problem list, inpatient nursing 
      question, social history free text, and social work notes) on a hospital encounter 
      basis (with patient-year metrics in the Supplementary Appendix). Our sample included 
      all patients (n = 27 127) with at least one hospitalization at UCSF Health (a large, 
      urban, tertiary medical center) over a 1-year period. RESULTS: We observed 
      substantial variation in the use of different SDOH EHR data types. Notably, social 
      history question fields (newly added at study period start) were rarely used (DDE: 
      0.03% of encounters, DBD: 0.26%, RDE: 0.03%). Free-text patient social history 
      fields had higher use (DDE: 12.1%, DBD: 49.0%, RDE: 14.4%). DISCUSSION: Our measures 
      of real-world SDOH data use can guide current efforts to capture and leverage these 
      data. For our institution, measures revealed substantial variation across data 
      types, suggesting the need to engage in efforts such as EHR-user education and 
      targeted workflow integration. CONCLUSION: Measures revealed opportunities to 
      optimize SDOH data documentation and review.

AB  - Dermatologists rely on skin biopsies to diagnose cutaneous tumors and rashes. Skin 
      biopsy sites should be accurately identified with conventional anatomical site 
      descriptors in the pathology request form. Reliance upon free-text entries to 
      describe these biopsy sites is prone to user error and can cause medical 
      misadventures such as wrong-site follow-up surgery. We sought to determine whether a 
      smartphone application (RightSite) could improve the precision of biopsy site 
      labeling. We conducted a prospective proof-of-concept study of 100 
      smartphone-assisted skin biopsy site identifiers with matched comparison to 100 
      historical controls. Student's t-test was used to identify significant differences 
      in the precision of anatomic descriptors before and after adoption of the 
      application. We found a 69% improvement in precision of anatomic site labeling with 
      the RightSite smartphone application (P < 0.0001). These data show 
      smartphone-assisted biopsy site labeling improves the precision of anatomic site 
      descriptors. Integrating graphical user interfaces into the electronic health 
      records system could improve health care by standardizing anatomic site nomenclature 
      and site-specific descriptors.

TI  - Correlating mammographic and pathologic findings in clinical decision support using 
      natural language processing and data mining methods.
PG  - 114-121
LID - 10.1002/cncr.30245 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A key challenge to mining electronic health records for mammography 
      research is the preponderance of unstructured narrative text, which strikingly 
      limits usable output. The imaging characteristics of breast cancer subtypes have 
      been described previously, but without standardization of parameters for data 
      mining. METHODS: The authors searched the enterprise-wide data warehouse at the 
      Houston Methodist Hospital, the Methodist Environment for Translational Enhancement 
      and Outcomes Research (METEOR), for patients with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data 
      System (BI-RADS) category 5 mammogram readings performed between January 2006 and 
      May 2015 and an available pathology report. The authors developed natural language 
      processing (NLP) software algorithms to automatically extract mammographic and 
      pathologic findings from free text mammogram and pathology reports. The correlation 
      between mammographic imaging features and breast cancer subtype was analyzed using 
      one-way analysis of variance and the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: The NLP algorithm 
      was able to obtain key characteristics for 543 patients who met the inclusion 
      criteria. Patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors were more likely to have 
      spiculated margins (P = .0008), and those with tumors that overexpressed human 
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were more likely to have heterogeneous and 
      pleomorphic calcifications (P = .0078 and P = .0002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Mammographic imaging characteristics, obtained from an automated text search and the 
      extraction of mammogram reports using NLP techniques, correlated with pathologic 
      breast cancer subtype. The results of the current study validate previously reported 
      trends assessed by manual data collection. Furthermore, NLP provides an automated 
      means with which to scale up data extraction and analysis for clinical decision 
      support. Cancer 2017;114-121. © 2016 American Cancer Society.

TI  - Construction and usability of community health nursing database in rural 
      north-eastern Thailand.
PG  - 515-523
LID - 10.1111/inr.12471 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTIONS: Digitization could be incorporated in rural areas of resource-poor 
      countries because information gathered by nurses working on-site could be better 
      used. BACKGROUND: For effective management of community health information, the 
      usage and maintenance of digital records are important. Digitization of information 
      provides essential information for informing health policy. AIM: To develop a 
      sustainable database to effectively collect and manage community health information 
      and nursing practice. METHODS: This study used a mixed method design. Phase 1 
      involved the development of a database system through repeated systematic focus 
      group discussions with community health nurses. Phase 2 involved a practical trial 
      examination of the developed system with both objective and subjective evaluations. 
      RESULTS: A nursing database system was developed with templates designed for the 
      major health problems of communities. The templates were composed of multiple-choice 
      items and a free-text field that allowed records to be more detailed than 
      handwritten records and maintained in standardized formats. This enables 
      accumulation of data that were less likely to be influenced by the variance of 
      ability in each nurse. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A multifaceted evaluation of the 
      database system suggested that it could improve the efficiency of information 
      management and contribute to the improvement of nursing care quality through 
      standardization of the recording pattern. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH 
      POLICY: The nursing database will enable high-quality information storage that will 
      potentially better inform health and healthcare policies as well as enable 
      visualization of data concerning nursing care challenges and activities within the 
      relevant communities. This information is essential for policy development and 
      implementation in areas of human and fiscal resource allocations and meeting 
      training/education needs.

TI  - Natural language processing for the assessment of cardiovascular disease 
      comorbidities: The cardio-Canary comorbidity project.
PG  - 1296-1304
LID - 10.1002/clc.23687 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Accurate ascertainment of comorbidities is paramount in clinical 
      research. While manual adjudication is labor-intensive and expensive, the adoption 
      of electronic health records enables computational analysis of free-text 
      documentation using natural language processing (NLP) tools. HYPOTHESIS: We sought 
      to develop highly accurate NLP modules to assess for the presence of five key 
      cardiovascular comorbidities in a large electronic health record system. METHODS: 
      One-thousand clinical notes were randomly selected from a cardiovascular registry at 
      Mass General Brigham. Trained physicians manually adjudicated these notes for the 
      following five diagnostic comorbidities: hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, 
      coronary artery disease, and stroke/transient ischemic attack. Using the open-source 
      Canary NLP system, five separate NLP modules were designed based on 800 
      "training-set" notes and validated on 200 "test-set" notes. RESULTS: Across the five 
      NLP modules, the sentence-level and note-level sensitivity, specificity, and 
      positive predictive value was always greater than 85% and was most often greater 
      than 90%. Accuracy tended to be highest for conditions with greater diagnostic 
      clarity (e.g. diabetes and hypertension) and slightly lower for conditions whose 
      greater diagnostic challenges (e.g. myocardial infarction and embolic stroke) may 
      lead to less definitive documentation. CONCLUSION: We designed five open-source and 
      highly accurate NLP modules that can be used to assess for the presence of important 
      cardiovascular comorbidities in free-text health records. These modules have been 
      placed in the public domain and can be used for clinical research, trial recruitment 
      and population management at any institution as well as serve as the basis for 
      further development of cardiovascular NLP tools.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records are invaluable for medical research, but much 
      information is stored as free text rather than in a coded form. For example, in the 
      UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD), causes of death and test results are 
      sometimes recorded only in free text. Free text can be difficult to use for research 
      if it requires time-consuming manual review. Our aim was to develop an automated 
      method for extracting coded information from free text in electronic patient 
      records. METHODS: We reviewed the electronic patient records in GPRD of a random 
      sample of 3310 patients who died in 2001, to identify the cause of death. We 
      developed a computer program called the Freetext Matching Algorithm (FMA) to map 
      diagnoses in text to the Read Clinical Terminology. The program uses lookup tables 
      of synonyms and phrase patterns to identify diagnoses, dates and selected test 
      results. We tested it on two random samples of free text from GPRD (1000 texts 
      associated with death in 2001, and 1000 general texts from cases and controls in a 
      coronary artery disease study), comparing the output to the U.S. National Library of 
      Medicine's MetaMap program and the gold standard of manual review. RESULTS: Among 
      3310 patients registered in the GPRD who died in 2001, the cause of death was 
      recorded in coded form in 38.1% of patients, and in the free text alone in 19.4%. On 
      the 1000 texts associated with death, FMA coded 683 of the 735 positive diagnoses, 
      with precision (positive predictive value) 98.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 97.2, 
      99.2) and recall (sensitivity) 92.9% (95% CI 90.8, 94.7). On the general sample, FMA 
      detected 346 of the 447 positive diagnoses, with precision 91.5% (95% CI 88.3, 94.1) 
      and recall 77.4% (95% CI 73.2, 81.2), which was similar to MetaMap. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      have developed an algorithm to extract coded information from free text in GP 
      records with good precision. It may facilitate research using free text in 
      electronic patient records, particularly for extracting the cause of death.

AB  - The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and the growing wealth 
      of digitized information sources about patients is ushering in an era of 'Big Data' 
      that may revolutionize clinical research in oncology. Research will likely be more 
      efficient and potentially more accurate than the current gold standard of manual 
      chart review studies. However, EHRs as they exist today have significant 
      limitations: important data elements are missing or are only captured in free text 
      or PDF documents. Using two case studies, we illustrate the challenges of leveraging 
      the data that are routinely collected by the healthcare system in EHRs (e.g., 
      real-world data), specific challenges encountered in the cancer domain and 
      opportunities that can be achieved when these are overcome.

      cancer.
PG  - e180-e187
LID - 10.3747/co.26.4163 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Variations in treatment choice, or late stage at first diagnosis, mean 
      that, despite guideline recommendations, not all patients with hormone receptor 
      (hr)-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (la/mbca) will have 
      received endocrine therapy before disease progression. In the present study, we 
      aimed to estimate the proportion of women with postmenopausal hr-positive la/mbca in 
      the United States who are endocrine therapy-naïve. METHODS: Women in the Optum 
      Electronic Health Record (ehr) database with a breast cancer (bca) diagnosis 
      (January 2008-March 2015) were included. Patient and malignancy characteristics were 
      identified using structured data fields and natural-language processing of free-text 
      clinical notes. The proportion of women with postmenopausal hr-positive, human 
      epidermal growth factor 2 (her2)-negative (or unknown) la/mbca who had not received 
      prior endocrine therapy was determined. Results were extrapolated to the entire U.S. 
      population using the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
      and End Results database. Results are presented descriptively. RESULTS: In the ehr 
      database, 11,831 women with bca had discernible information on postmenopausal 
      status, hr status, and disease stage. Of those women, 1923 (16.3%) had 
      postmenopausal hr-positive, her2-negative (or unknown) la/mbca, and 70.7% of those 
      1923 patients (n = 1360) had not received prior endocrine therapy, accounting for 
      11.5% of the overall population. Extrapolating those estimates nationally suggests 
      an annual incidence of 14,784 cases, and a 5-year limited duration prevalence of 
      50,638 cases. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of women with postmenopausal 
      hr-positive la/mbca in the United States could be endocrine therapy-naïve.

TI  - Disease Concept-Embedding Based on the Self-Supervised Method for Medical 
      Information Extraction from Electronic Health Records and Disease Retrieval: 
      Algorithm Development and Validation Study.
PG  - e25113
LID - 10.2196/25113 [doi]
LID - e25113
AB  - BACKGROUND: The electronic health record (EHR) contains a wealth of medical 
      information. An organized EHR can greatly help doctors treat patients. In some 
      cases, only limited patient information is collected to help doctors make treatment 
      decisions. Because EHRs can serve as a reference for this limited information, 
      doctors' treatment capabilities can be enhanced. Natural language processing and 
      deep learning methods can help organize and translate EHR information into medical 
      knowledge and experience. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to create a model to 
      extract concept embeddings from EHRs for disease pattern retrieval and further 
      classification tasks. METHODS: We collected 1,040,989 emergency department visits 
      from the National Taiwan University Hospital Integrated Medical Database and 305,897 
      samples from the National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey Emergency 
      Department data. After data cleansing and preprocessing, the data sets were divided 
      into training, validation, and test sets. We proposed a Transformer-based model to 
      embed EHRs and used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) 
      to extract features from free text and concatenate features with structural data as 
      input to our proposed model. Then, Deep InfoMax (DIM) and Simple Contrastive 
      Learning of Visual Representations (SimCLR) were used for the unsupervised embedding 
      of the disease concept. The pretrained disease concept-embedding model, named 
      EDisease, was further finetuned to adapt to the critical care outcome prediction 
      task. We evaluated the performance of embedding using t-distributed stochastic 
      neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to perform dimension reduction for visualization. The 
      performance of the finetuned predictive model was evaluated against published models 
      using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). RESULTS: The 
      performance of our model on the outcome prediction had the highest AUROC of 0.876. 
      In the ablation study, the use of a smaller data set or fewer unsupervised methods 
      for pretraining deteriorated the prediction performance. The AUROCs were 0.857, 
      0.870, and 0.868 for the model without pretraining, the model pretrained by only 
      SimCLR, and the model pretrained by only DIM, respectively. On the smaller 
      finetuning set, the AUROC was 0.815 for the proposed model. CONCLUSIONS: Through 
      contrastive learning methods, disease concepts can be embedded meaningfully. 
      Moreover, these methods can be used for disease retrieval tasks to enhance clinical 
      practice capabilities. The disease concept model is also suitable as a pretrained 
      model for subsequent prediction tasks.

      Reports Using Natural Language Processing.
PG  - 515-524
AB  - Free-text reports in electronic health records (EHRs) contain medically significant 
      information - signs, symptoms, findings, diagnoses - recorded by clinicians during 
      patient encounters. These reports contain rich clinical information which can be 
      leveraged for surveillance of disease and occurrence of adverse events. In order to 
      gain meaningful knowledge from these text reports to support surveillance efforts, 
      information must first be converted into a structured, computable format. 
      Traditional methods rely on manual review of charts, which can be costly and 
      inefficient. Natural language processing (NLP) methods offer an efficient, 
      alternative approach to extracting the information and can achieve a similar level 
      of accuracy. We developed an NLP system to automatically identify mentions of 
      surgical site infections in radiology reports and classify reports containing 
      evidence of surgical site infections leveraging these mentions. We evaluated our 
      system using a reference standard of reports annotated by domain experts, 
      administrative data generated for each patient encounter, and a machine 
      learning-based approach.

TI  - Representation of information about family relatives as structured data in 
      electronic health records.
PG  - 349-67
LID - 10.4338/ACI-2013-10-RA-0080 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ability to manage and leverage family history information in the 
      electronic health record (EHR) is crucial to delivering high-quality clinical care. 
      OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate existing standards in representing relative 
      information, examine this information documented in EHRs, and develop a natural 
      language processing (NLP) application to extract relative information from free-text 
      clinical documents. METHODS: We reviewed a random sample of 100 admission notes and 
      100 discharge summaries of 198 patients, and also reviewed the structured entries 
      for these patients in an EHR system's family history module. We investigated the two 
      standards used by Stage 2 of Meaningful Use (SNOMED CT and HL7 Family History 
      Standard) and identified coverage gaps of each standard in coding relative 
      information. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the MTERMS NLP system in 
      identifying relative information from free-text documents. RESULTS: The structure 
      and content of SNOMED CT and HL7 for representing relative information are different 
      in several ways. Both terminologies have high coverage to represent local relative 
      concepts built in an ambulatory EHR system, but gaps in key concept coverage were 
      detected; coverage rates for relative information in free-text clinical documents 
      were 95.2% and 98.6%, respectively. Compared to structured entries, richer family 
      history information was only available in free-text documents. Using a comprehensive 
      lexicon that included concepts and terms of relative information from different 
      sources, we expanded the MTERMS NLP system to extract and encode relative 
      information in clinical documents and achieved a corresponding precision of 100% and 
      recall of 97.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive assessment and user guidance are 
      critical to adopting standards into EHR systems in a meaningful way. A significant 
      portion of patients' family history information is only documented in free-text 
      clinical documents and NLP can be used to extract this information.

TI  - EHR phenotyping via jointly embedding medical concepts and words into a unified 
      vector space.
PG  - 123

AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been an increasing interest in learning low-dimensional vector 
      representations of medical concepts from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Vector 
      representations of medical concepts facilitate exploratory analysis and predictive 
      modeling of EHR data to gain insights about the patterns of care and health 
      outcomes. EHRs contain structured data such as diagnostic codes and laboratory 
      tests, as well as unstructured free text data in form of clinical notes, which 
      provide more detail about condition and treatment of patients. METHODS: In this 
      work, we propose a method that jointly learns vector representations of medical 
      concepts and words. This is achieved by a novel learning scheme based on the 
      word2vec model. Our model learns those relationships by integrating clinical notes 
      and sets of accompanying medical codes and by defining joint contexts for each 
      observed word and medical code. RESULTS: In our experiments, we learned joint 
      representations using MIMIC-III data. Using the learned representations of words and 
      medical codes, we evaluated phenotypes for 6 diseases discovered by our and baseline 
      method. The experimental results show that for each of the 6 diseases our method 
      finds highly relevant words. We also show that our representations can be very 
      useful when predicting the reason for the next visit. CONCLUSIONS: The jointly 
      learned representations of medical concepts and words capture not only similarity 
      between codes or words themselves, but also similarity between codes and words. They 
      can be used to extract phenotypes of different diseases. The representations learned 
      by the joint model are also useful for construction of patient features.

TI  - Coreference resolution: a review of general methodologies and applications in the 
      clinical domain.
PG  - 1113-22
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2011.08.006 [doi]
AB  - Coreference resolution is the task of determining linguistic expressions that refer 
      to the same real-world entity in natural language. Research on coreference 
      resolution in the general English domain dates back to 1960s and 1970s. However, 
      research on coreference resolution in the clinical free text has not seen major 
      development. The recent US government initiatives that promote the use of electronic 
      health records (EHRs) provide opportunities to mine patient notes as more and more 
      health care institutions adopt EHR. Our goal was to review recent advances in 
      general purpose coreference resolution to lay the foundation for methodologies in 
      the clinical domain, facilitated by the availability of a shared lexical resource of 
      gold standard coreference annotations, the Ontology Development and Information 
      Extraction (ODIE) corpus.

TI  - Identification of the delivery of cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) 
      using a cross-sectional sample from electronic health records and open-text 
      information in a large UK-based mental health case register.
PG  - e015297
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015297 [doi]
LID - e015297
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our primary objective was to identify cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) 
      delivery for people with psychosis (CBTp) using an automated method in a large 
      electronic health record database. We also examined what proportion of service users 
      with a diagnosis of psychosis were recorded as having received CBTp within their 
      episode of care during defined time periods provided by early intervention or 
      promoting recovery community services for people with psychosis, compared with 
      published audits and whether demographic characteristics differentially predicted 
      the receipt of CBTp. METHODS: Both free text using natural language processing (NLP) 
      techniques and structured methods of identifying CBTp were combined and evaluated 
      for positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity. Using inclusion criteria from 
      two published audits, we identified anonymised cross-sectional samples of 2579 and 
      2308 service users respectively with a case note diagnosis of schizophrenia or 
      psychosis for further analysis. RESULTS: The method achieved PPV of 95% and 
      sensitivity of 96%. Using the National Audit of Schizophrenia 2 criteria, 34.6% 
      service users were identified as ever having received at least one session and 26.4% 
      at least two sessions of CBTp; these are higher percentages than previously reported 
      by manual audit of a sample from the same trust that returned 20.0%. In the fully 
      adjusted analysis, CBTp receipt was significantly (p<0.05) more likely in younger 
      patients, in white and other when compared with black ethnic groups and patients 
      with a diagnosis of other schizophrenia spectrum and schizoaffective disorder when 
      compared with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: The methods presented here provided a 
      potential method for evaluating delivery of CBTp on a large scale, providing more 
      scope for routine monitoring, cross-site comparisons and the promotion of equitable 
      access.

TI  - Toward a Learning Health-care System - Knowledge Delivery at the Point of Care 
      Empowered by Big Data and NLP.
PG  - 13-22
LID - 10.4137/BII.S37977 [doi]
AB  - The concept of optimizing health care by understanding and generating knowledge from 
      previous evidence, ie, the Learning Health-care System (LHS), has gained momentum 
      and now has national prominence. Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of electronic health 
      records (EHRs) enables the data collection required to form the basis for 
      facilitating LHS. A prerequisite for using EHR data within the LHS is an 
      infrastructure that enables access to EHR data longitudinally for health-care 
      analytics and real time for knowledge delivery. Additionally, significant clinical 
      information is embedded in the free text, making natural language processing (NLP) 
      an essential component in implementing an LHS. Herein, we share our institutional 
      implementation of a big data-empowered clinical NLP infrastructure, which not only 
      enables health-care analytics but also has real-time NLP processing capability. The 
      infrastructure has been utilized for multiple institutional projects including the 
      MayoExpertAdvisor, an individualized care recommendation solution for clinical care. 
      We compared the advantages of big data over two other environments. Big data 
      infrastructure significantly outperformed other infrastructure in terms of computing 
      speed, demonstrating its value in making the LHS a possibility in the near future.

TI  - A European inventory of data elements for patient recruitment.
PG  - 506-10
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the last few years much work has been conducted in creating systems 
      that support clinical trials for example by utilizing electronic health record data. 
      One of these endeavours is the Electronic Health Record for Clinical Research 
      project (EHR4CR). An unanswered question that the project aims to answer is which 
      data elements are most commonly required for patient recruitment. METHODS: Free text 
      eligibility criteria from 40 studies were analysed, simplified and elements were 
      extracted. These elements where then added to an existing inventory of data elements 
      for protocol feasibility. RESULTS: We simplified and extracted data elements from 40 
      trials, which resulted in 1170 elements. From these we created an inventory of 150 
      unique data elements relevant for patient identification and recruitment with 
      definitions and referenced codes to standard terminologies. DISCUSSION: Our list was 
      created with expertise from pharmaceutical companies. Comparisons with related work 
      shows that identified concepts are similar. An evaluation of the availability of 
      these elements in electronic health records is still ongoing. Hospitals that want to 
      engage in re-use of electronic health record data for research purposes, for example 
      by joining networks like EHR4CR, can now prioritize their effort based on this list.

TI  - Key Contributions in Clinical Research Informatics.
PG  - 233-238
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1726514 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To summarize key contributions to current research in the field of 
      Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) and to select best papers published in 2020. 
      METHOD: A bibliographic search using a combination of Medical Subject Headings 
      (MeSH) descriptors and free-text terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed 
      by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be 
      then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus 
      meeting between two section editors and the editorial team was organized to finally 
      conclude on the selected four best papers. RESULTS: Among the 877 papers published 
      in 2020 and returned by the search, there were four best papers selected. The first 
      best paper describes a method for mining temporal sequences from clinical documents 
      to infer disease trajectories and enhancing high-throughput phenotyping. The authors 
      of the second best paper demonstrate that the generation of synthetic Electronic 
      Health Record (EHR) data through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) could be 
      substantially improved by more appropriate training and evaluation criteria. The 
      third best paper offers an efficient advance on methods to detect adverse drug 
      events by computer-assisting expert reviewers with annotated candidate mentions in 
      clinical documents. The large-scale data quality assessment study reported by the 
      fourth best paper has clinical research informatics implications, in terms of the 
      trustworthiness of inferences made from analysing electronic health records. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The most significant research efforts in the CRI field are currently 
      focusing on data science with active research in the development and evaluation of 
      Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms based on ever more 
      intensive use of real-world data and especially EHR real or synthetic data. A major 
      lesson that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has already taught the 
      scientific CRI community is that timely international high-quality data-sharing and 
      collaborative data analysis is absolutely vital to inform policy decisions.

TI  - Physician perceptions of documentation methods in electronic health records.
PG  - 1460458221989399
LID - 10.1177/1460458221989399 [doi]
AB  - This study sought to determine physician, specialty and practice factors influencing 
      choice of method for electronic health record (EHR) documentation: direct typing 
      (DT), electronic transcription (ET), human transcription (HT), and scribes. A survey 
      assessing physician documentation practices was developed and distributed online. 
      The primary outcome was the proportion of physicians using each method. Secondary 
      outcomes were provider-rated accuracy, efficiency, and ease of navigation on a 1-5 
      Likert scale. Means were compared using linear mixed models with Bonferroni 
      adjustment. The 818 respondents were mostly outpatient (46%) adult (79%) physicians, 
      practiced for a mean 15.8 years, and used DT for EHR documentation (72%). Emergency 
      physicians were more likely to use scribes (p < 0.0001). DT was rated less efficient 
      than all other methods (p < 0.0001). ET was rated less accurate than DT (p < 0.001) 
      and HT (p < 0.001). HT was rated less easy to navigate than DT (p = 0.002) and 
      scribe (p < 0.001), and ET less than scribe (p = 0.002). Two hundred and forty-three 
      respondents provided free-text comments that further described opinions. DT was the 
      most commonly used EHR method but rated least efficient. Scribes were rated easy to 
      navigate and efficient but infrequently used outside of emergency settings. Further 
      innovation is needed to design systems responsive to all physician EHR needs.

TI  - Defining and Assessing Geriatric Risk Factors and Associated Health Care Utilization 
      Among Older Adults Using Claims and Electronic Health Records.
PG  - 233-239
LID - 10.1097/MLR.0000000000000865 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Using electronic health records (EHRs), in addition to claims, to 
      systematically identify patients with factors associated with adverse outcomes 
      (geriatric risk) among older adults can prove beneficial for population health 
      management and clinical service delivery. OBJECTIVE: To define and compare geriatric 
      risk factors derivable from claims, structured EHRs, and unstructured EHRs, and 
      estimate the relationship between geriatric risk factors and health care 
      utilization. RESEARCH DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients 
      enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan from 2011 to 2013 using both administrative 
      claims and EHRs. We defined 10 individual geriatric risk factors and a summary 
      geriatric risk index based on diagnosed conditions and pattern matching techniques 
      applied to EHR free text. The prevalence of geriatric risk factors was estimated 
      using claims, structured EHRs, and structured and unstructured EHRs combined. The 
      association of geriatric risk index with any occurrence of hospitalizations, 
      emergency department visits, and nursing home visits were estimated using logistic 
      regression adjusted for demographic and comorbidity covariates. RESULTS: The 
      prevalence of geriatric risk factors increased after adding unstructured EHR data to 
      structured EHRs, compared with those derived from structured EHRs alone and claims 
      alone. On the basis of claims, structured EHRs, and structured and unstructured EHRs 
      combined, 12.9%, 15.0%, and 24.6% of the patients had 1 geriatric risk factor, 
      respectively; 3.9%, 4.2%, and 15.8% had ≥2 geriatric risk factors, respectively. 
      Statistically significant association between geriatric risk index and health care 
      utilization was found independent of demographic and comorbidity covariates. For 
      example, based on claims, estimated odds ratios for having 1 and ≥2 geriatric risk 
      factors in year 1 were 1.49 (P<0.001) and 2.62 (P<0.001) in predicting any 
      occurrence of hospitalizations in year 1, and 1.32 (P<0.001) and 1.34 (P=0.003) in 
      predicting any occurrence of hospitalizations in year 2. CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      demonstrate the feasibility and potential of using EHRs and claims for collecting 
      new types of geriatric risk information that could augment the more commonly 
      collected disease information to identify and move upstream the management of 
      high-risk cases among older patients.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Assesses Clinician's Adherence to Asthma Guidelines using 
      Electronic Health Records.
LID - S2213-2198(21)01266-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jaip.2021.11.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinician's asthma guideline adherence in asthma care is suboptimal. The 
      effort for improving adherence can be enhanced by assessing and monitoring 
      clinician's adherence to guidelines reflected in electronic health records (EHRs) 
      which yet requires costly manual chart review since many care elements cannot be 
      identified by structured data. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to demonstrate the 
      feasibility of an artificial intelligence (AI) tool using natural language 
      processing (NLP) leveraging free text of EHRs of pediatric patients to extract key 
      components of the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines. 
      METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study using a birth cohort with 
      asthma diagnosis at Mayo Clinic between 2003 and 2016. We used 1,039 clinical notes 
      with an asthma diagnosis from a random sample of 300 patients. Rule-based NLP 
      algorithms were developed to identify asthma guideline congruent elements by 
      examining care description in EHR free text. RESULTS: NLP algorithms demonstrated a 
      sensitivity (0.82 - 1.0), specificity (0.95 - 1.0), positive predictive value (0.86 
      -1.0), and negative protective value (0.92 - 1.0) against manual chart review for 
      asthma guideline-congruent elements. Assessing medication compliance and inhaler 
      technique assessment were the most challenging elements to assess due to the 
      complexity and wide variety of descriptions. CONCLUSION: NLP technologies may enable 
      automated assessment of clinician's documentation in EHRs regarding adherence to 
      asthma guidelines and can be a useful population management and research tool for 
      assessing and monitoring asthma care quality. Multi-site studies with a larger 
      sample size are needed for assessing the generalizability of our NLP algorithms.

TI  - Investigating Longitudinal Tobacco Use Information from Social History and Clinical 
      Notes in the Electronic Health Record.
PG  - 1209-1218
AB  - The electronic health record (EHR) provides an opportunity for improved use of 
      clinical documentation including leveraging tobacco use information by clinicians 
      and researchers. In this study, we investigated the content, consistency, and 
      completeness of tobacco use data from structured and unstructured sources in the 
      EHR. A natural language process (NLP) pipeline was utilized to extract details about 
      tobacco use from clinical notes and free-text tobacco use comments within the social 
      history module of an EHR system. We analyzed the consistency of tobacco use 
      information within clinical notes, comments, and available structured fields for 
      tobacco use. Our results indicate that structured fields for tobacco use alone may 
      not be able to provide complete tobacco use information. While there was better 
      consistency for some elements (e.g., status and type), inconsistencies were found 
      particularly for temporal information. Further work is needed to improve tobacco use 
      information integration from different parts of the EHR.

TI  - Querying archetype-based EHRs by search ontology-based XPath engineering.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/s13326-018-0180-2 [doi]
LID - 16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Legacy data and new structured data can be stored in a standardized 
      format as XML-based EHRs on XML databases. Querying documents on these databases is 
      crucial for answering research questions. Instead of using free text searches, that 
      lead to false positive results, the precision can be increased by constraining the 
      search to certain parts of documents. METHODS: A search ontology-based specification 
      of queries on XML documents defines search concepts and relates them to parts in the 
      XML document structure. Such query specification method is practically introduced 
      and evaluated by applying concrete research questions formulated in natural language 
      on a data collection for information retrieval purposes. The search is performed by 
      search ontology-based XPath engineering that reuses ontologies and XML-related W3C 
      standards. RESULTS: The key result is that the specification of research questions 
      can be supported by the usage of search ontology-based XPath engineering. A deeper 
      recognition of entities and a semantic understanding of the content is necessary for 
      a further improvement of precision and recall. Key limitation is that the 
      application of the introduced process requires skills in ontology and software 
      development. In future, the time consuming ontology development could be overcome by 
      implementing a new clinical role: the clinical ontologist. CONCLUSION: The 
      introduced Search Ontology XML extension connects Search Terms to certain parts in 
      XML documents and enables an ontology-based definition of queries. Search 
      ontology-based XPath engineering can support research question answering by the 
      specification of complex XPath expressions without deep syntax knowledge about 
      XPaths.

TI  - Dense Annotation of Free-Text Critical Care Discharge Summaries from an Indian 
      Hospital and Associated Performance of a Clinical NLP Annotator.
PG  - 187
LID - 10.1007/s10916-016-0541-2 [doi]
AB  - Electronic Health Record (EHR) use in India is generally poor, and structured 
      clinical information is mostly lacking. This work is the first attempt aimed at 
      evaluating unstructured text mining for extracting relevant clinical information 
      from Indian clinical records. We annotated a corpus of 250 discharge summaries from 
      an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in India, with markups for diseases, procedures, and 
      lab parameters, their attributes, as well as key demographic information and 
      administrative variables such as patient outcomes. In this process, we have 
      constructed guidelines for an annotation scheme useful to clinicians in the Indian 
      context. We evaluated the performance of an NLP engine, Cocoa, on a cohort of these 
      Indian clinical records. We have produced an annotated corpus of roughly 90 thousand 
      words, which to our knowledge is the first tagged clinical corpus from India. Cocoa 
      was evaluated on a test corpus of 50 documents. The overlap F-scores across the 
      major categories, namely disease/symptoms, procedures, laboratory parameters and 
      outcomes, are 0.856, 0.834, 0.961 and 0.872 respectively. These results are 
      competitive with results from recent shared tasks based on US records. The annotated 
      corpus and associated results from the Cocoa engine indicate that unstructured text 
      mining is a viable method for cohort analysis in the Indian clinical context, where 
      structured EHR records are largely absent.

TI  - Structuring Clinical Decision Support Rules for Drug Safety Using Natural Language 
      Processing.
PG  - 89-92
AB  - Drug safety is an important aspect in healthcare, resulting in a number of 
      inadvertent events, which may harm the patients. IT based Clinical Decision Support 
      (CDS), integrated in electronic-prescription or Electronic Health Records (EHR) 
      systems, can provide a means for checking prescriptions for errors. This requires 
      expressing prescription guidelines in a way that can be interpreted by IT systems. 
      The paper uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), to interpret drug guidelines by 
      the UK NICE BNF offered in free text. The employed NLP component, MetaMap, 
      identifies the concepts in the instructions and interprets their semantic meaning. 
      The UMLS semantic types that correspond to these concepts are then processed, in 
      order to understand the concepts that are needed to be implemented in software 
      engineering for a CDS engine.

AB  - Free-text clinical notes in electronic health records are more difficult for data 
      mining while the structured diagnostic codes can be missing or erroneous. To improve 
      the quality of diagnostic codes, this work extracts diagnostic codes from free-text 
      notes: five old and new word vectorization methods were used to vectorize Stanford 
      progress notes and predict eight ICD-10 codes of common cardiovascular diseases with 
      logistic regression. The models showed good performance, with TF-IDF as the best 
      vectorization model showing the highest AUROC (0.9499-0.9915) and AUPRC 
      (0.2956-0.8072). The models also showed transferability when tested on MIMIC-III 
      data with AUROC from 0.7952 to 0.9790 and AUPRC from 0.2353 to 0.8084. Model 
      interpretability was shown by the important words with clinical meanings matching 
      each disease. This study shows the feasibility of accurately extracting structured 
      diagnostic codes, imputing missing codes, and correcting erroneous codes from 
      free-text clinical notes for information retrieval and downstream machine-learning 
      applications.

TI  - Reviewing 741 patients records in two hours with FASTVISU.
PG  - 553-9
AB  - The secondary use of electronic health records opens up new perspectives. They 
      provide researchers with structured data and unstructured data, including free text 
      reports. Many applications been developed to leverage knowledge from free-text 
      reports, but manual review of documents is still a complex process. We developed 
      FASTVISU a web-based application to assist clinicians in reviewing documents. We 
      used FASTVISU to review a set of 6340 documents from 741 patients suffering from the 
      celiac disease. A first automated selection pruned the original set to 847 documents 
      from 276 patients' records. The records were reviewed by two trained physicians to 
      identify the presence of 15 auto-immune diseases. It took respectively two hours and 
      two hours and a half to evaluate the entire corpus. Inter-annotator agreement was 
      high (Cohen's kappa at 0.89). FASTVISU is a user-friendly modular solution to 
      validate entities extracted by NLP methods from free-text documents stored in 
      clinical data warehouses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records are being increasingly used by nurses with up 
      to 80% of the health data recorded as free text. However, only a few studies have 
      developed nursing-relevant tools that help busy clinicians to identify information 
      they need at the point of care. OBJECTIVE: This study developed and validated one of 
      the first automated natural language processing applications to extract wound 
      information (wound type, pressure ulcer stage, wound size, anatomic location, and 
      wound treatment) from free text clinical notes. METHODS AND DESIGN: First, two human 
      annotators manually reviewed a purposeful training sample (n=360) and random test 
      sample (n=1100) of clinical notes (including 50% discharge summaries and 50% 
      outpatient notes), identified wound cases, and created a gold standard dataset. We 
      then trained and tested our natural language processing system (known as MTERMS) to 
      process the wound information. Finally, we assessed our automated approach by 
      comparing system-generated findings against the gold standard. We also compared the 
      prevalence of wound cases identified from free-text data with coded diagnoses in the 
      structured data. RESULTS: The testing dataset included 101 notes (9.2%) with wound 
      information. The overall system performance was good (F-measure is a compiled 
      measure of system's accuracy=92.7%), with best results for wound treatment 
      (F-measure=95.7%) and poorest results for wound size (F-measure=81.9%). Only 46.5% 
      of wound notes had a structured code for a wound diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The natural 
      language processing system achieved good performance on a subset of randomly 
      selected discharge summaries and outpatient notes. In more than half of the wound 
      notes, there were no coded wound diagnoses, which highlight the significance of 
      using natural language processing to enrich clinical decision making. Our future 
      steps will include expansion of the application's information coverage to other 
      relevant wound factors and validation of the model with external data.

TI  - Designing a system for patients controlling providers' access to their electronic 
      health records: organizational and technical challenges.
PG  - S17-24
LID - 10.1007/s11606-014-3055-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs) are proliferating, and financial 
      incentives encourage their use. Applying Fair Information Practice principles to 
      EHRs necessitates balancing patients' rights to control their personal information 
      with providers' data needs to deliver safe, high-quality care. We describe the 
      technical and organizational challenges faced in capturing patients' preferences for 
      patient-controlled EHR access and applying those preferences to an existing EHR. 
      METHODS: We established an online system for capturing patients' preferences for who 
      could view their EHRs (listing all participating clinic providers individually and 
      categorically-physicians, nurses, other staff) and what data to redact (none, all, 
      or by specific categories of sensitive data or patient age). We then modified 
      existing data-viewing software serving a state-wide health information exchange and 
      a large urban health system and its primary care clinics to allow patients' 
      preferences to guide data displays to providers. RESULTS: Patients could allow or 
      restrict data displays to all clinicians and staff in a demonstration primary care 
      clinic, categories of providers (physicians, nurses, others), or individual 
      providers. They could also restrict access to all EHR data or any or all of five 
      categories of sensitive data (mental and reproductive health, sexually transmitted 
      diseases, HIV/AIDS, and substance abuse) and for specific patient ages. The EHR 
      viewer displayed data via reports, data flowsheets, and coded and free text data 
      displayed by Google-like searches. Unless patients recorded restrictions, by default 
      all requested data were displayed to all providers. Data patients wanted restricted 
      were not displayed, with no indication they were redacted. Technical barriers 
      prevented redacting restricted information in free textnotes. The program allowed 
      providers to hit a "Break the Glass" button to override patients' restrictions, 
      recording the date, time, and next screen viewed. Establishing patient-control over 
      EHR data displays was complex and required ethical, clinical, database, and 
      programming expertise and difficult choices to overcome technical and health system 
      constraints. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing patients' preferences for access to their EHRs 
      and applying them in clinical practice requires wide-ranging technical, clinical, 
      and bioethical expertise, to make tough choices to overcome significant technical 
      and organization challenges.

TI  - The EHR and building the patient's story: A qualitative investigation of how EHR use 
      obstructs a vital clinical activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent research has suggested that using electronic health records 
      (EHRs) can negatively impact clinical reasoning (CR) and interprofessional 
      collaborative practices (ICPs). Understanding the benefits and obstacles that EHR 
      use introduces into clinical activities is essential for improving medical 
      documentation, while also supporting CR and ICP. METHODS: This qualitative study was 
      a longitudinal pre/post investigation of the impact of EHR implementation on CR and 
      ICP at a large pediatric hospital. We collected data via observations, interviews, 
      document analysis, and think-aloud/-after sessions. Using constructivist Grounded 
      Theory's iterative cycles of data collection and analysis, we identified and 
      explored an emerging theme that clinicians described as central to their CR and ICP 
      activities: building the patient's story. We studied how building the patient's 
      story was impacted by the introduction and implementation of an EHR. RESULTS: 
      Clinicians described the patient's story as a cognitive awareness and overview 
      understanding of the patient's (1) current status, (2) relevant history, (3) data 
      patterns that emerged during care, and (4) the future-oriented care plan. 
      Constructed by consolidating and interpreting a wide array of patient data, building 
      the patient's story was described as a vitally important skill that was required to 
      provide patient-centered care, within an interprofessional team, that safeguards 
      patient safety and clinicians' professional credibility. Our data revealed that EHR 
      use obstructed clinicians' ability to build the patient's story by fragmenting data 
      interconnections. Further, the EHR limited the number and size of free-text spaces 
      available for narrative notes. This constraint inhibited clinicians' ability to read 
      the why and how interpretations of clinical activities from other team members. This 
      resulted in the loss of shared interprofessional understanding of the patient's 
      story, and the increased time required to build the patient's story. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      discuss these findings in relation to research on the role of narratives for 
      enabling CR and ICP. We conclude that EHRs have yet to truly fulfill their promise 
      to support clinicians in their patient care activities, including the essential work 
      of building the patient's story.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Mortality Probability Model (MPM) is used in research and quality 
      improvement to adjust for severity of illness and can also inform triage decisions. 
      However, a limitation for its automated use or application is that it includes the 
      variable "intracranial mass effect" (IME), which requires human engagement with the 
      electronic health record (EHR). We developed and tested a natural language 
      processing (NLP) algorithm to identify IME from CT head reports. METHODS: We 
      obtained initial CT head reports from adult patients who were admitted to the ICU 
      from our ED between 10/2013 and 9/2016. Each head CT head report was labeled yes/no 
      IME by at least two of five independent labelers. The reports were then randomly 
      divided 80/20 into training and test sets. All reports were preprocessed to remove 
      linguistic and style variability, and a dictionary was created to map similar common 
      terms. We tested three vectorization strategies: Term Frequency-Inverse Document 
      frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec, and Universal Sentence Encoder to convert the report 
      text to a numerical vector. This vector served as the input to a 
      classification-tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithm (XGBoost). After 
      training, model performance was assessed in the test set using the area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). We also divided the continuous 
      range of scores into positive/inconclusive/negative categories for IME. RESULTS: Of 
      the 1202 CT reports in the training set, 308 (25.6%) reports were manually labeled 
      as "yes" for IME. Of the 355 reports in the test set, 108 (30.4%) were labeled as 
      "yes" for IME. The TF-IDF vectorization strategy as an input for the XGBoost model 
      had the best AUROC:-- 0.9625 (95% CI 0.9443-0.9807). TF-IDF score categories were 
      defined and had the following likelihood ratios: "positive" (TF-IDF score > 0.5) 
      LR = 24.59; "inconclusive" (TF-IDF 0.05-0.5) LR = 0.99; and "negative" 
      (TF-IDF < 0.05) LR = 0.05. 82% of reports were classified as either "positive" or 
      "negative". In the test set, only 4 of 199 (2.0%) reports with a "negative" 
      classification were false negatives and only 8 of 93 (8.6%) reports classified as 
      "positive" were false positives. CONCLUSION: NLP can accurately identify IME from 
      free-text reports of head CTs in approximately 80% of records, adequate to allow 
      automatic calculation of MPM based on EHR data for many applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-VEGF drugs are currently used to treat macular diseases. This has 
      led to a wealth of additional data, which could help understand and predict 
      treatment courses; however, this information is usually only available in free text 
      form. OBJECTIVE: A retrospective study was designed to analyze how far interpretable 
      information can be obtained from clinical texts by automated extraction. The aim was 
      to assess the suitability of a text mining method that was customized for this 
      purpose. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data on 3683 patients were available, including 
      40,485 discharge letters. Some of the data of interest, e.g. visual acuity (VA), 
      intraocular pressure (IOP) and accompanying diagnoses, were not only recorded 
      textually but also entered in a database and could thus serve as a gold standard for 
      text analysis. The text was analyzed using the Averbis Health Discovery text mining 
      platform. To optimize the extraction task, rule knowledge and a German language 
      technical vocabulary linked to the international medical terminology standard 
      systematized nomenclature of medicine (SNOMED CT) was manually added. RESULTS: The 
      correspondence between extracted data and the structured database entries is 
      described by the F1 value. There was agreement of 94.7% for VA, 98.3% for IOP and 
      94.7% for the accompanying diagnoses. Manual analysis of noncorresponding cases 
      showed that in 50% text content did not match the database content for various 
      reasons. After an adjustment, F1 values 1-3% above the previously determined values 
      were obtained. CONCLUSION: Text mining procedures are very well suited for the 
      considered discharge letter corpus and the problem described in order to extract 
      contents from clinical texts in a structured manner for further evaluation.

AB  - The detection of Adverse Medical Events (AMEs) plays an important role in disease 
      management in ensuring efficient treatment delivery and quality improvement of 
      health services. Recently, with the rapid development of hospital information 
      systems, a large volume of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have been produced, in 
      which AMEs are regularly documented in a free-text manner. In this study, we are 
      concerned with the problem of AME detection by utilizing a large volume of 
      unstructured EHR data. To address this challenge, we propose a neural attention 
      network-based model to incorporate the contextual information of words into AME 
      detection. Specifically, we develop a context-aware attention mechanism to locate 
      salient words with respect to the target AMEs in patient medical records. And then 
      we combine the proposed context attention mechanism with the deep learning tactic to 
      boost the performance of AME detection. We validate our proposed model on a real 
      clinical dataset that consists of 8845 medical records of patients with 
      cardiovascular diseases. The experimental results show that our proposed model 
      advances state-of-the-art models and achieves competitive performance in terms of 
      AME detection.

TI  - Supporting information retrieval from electronic health records: A report of 
      University of Michigan's nine-year experience in developing and using the Electronic 
      Medical Record Search Engine (EMERSE).
PG  - 290-300

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the University of Michigan's nine-year experience in 
      developing and using a full-text search engine designed to facilitate information 
      retrieval (IR) from narrative documents stored in electronic health records (EHRs). 
      The system, called the Electronic Medical Record Search Engine (EMERSE), functions 
      similar to Google but is equipped with special functionalities for handling 
      challenges unique to retrieving information from medical text. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Key features that distinguish EMERSE from general-purpose search engines 
      are discussed, with an emphasis on functions crucial to (1) improving medical IR 
      performance and (2) assuring search quality and results consistency regardless of 
      users' medical background, stage of training, or level of technical expertise. 
      RESULTS: Since its initial deployment, EMERSE has been enthusiastically embraced by 
      clinicians, administrators, and clinical and translational researchers. To date, the 
      system has been used in supporting more than 750 research projects yielding 80 
      peer-reviewed publications. In several evaluation studies, EMERSE demonstrated very 
      high levels of sensitivity and specificity in addition to greatly improved chart 
      review efficiency. DISCUSSION: Increased availability of electronic data in 
      healthcare does not automatically warrant increased availability of information. The 
      success of EMERSE at our institution illustrates that free-text EHR search engines 
      can be a valuable tool to help practitioners and researchers retrieve information 
      from EHRs more effectively and efficiently, enabling critical tasks such as patient 
      case synthesis and research data abstraction. CONCLUSION: EMERSE, available free of 
      charge for academic use, represents a state-of-the-art medical IR tool with proven 
      effectiveness and user acceptance.

TI  - Cognitive Impairments in Schizophrenia: A Study in a Large Clinical Sample Using 
      Natural Language Processing.
PG  - 711941
LID - 10.3389/fdgth.2021.711941 [doi]
LID - 711941
AB  - Background: Cognitive impairments are a neglected aspect of schizophrenia despite 
      being a major factor of poor functional outcome. They are usually measured using 
      various rating scales, however, these necessitate trained practitioners and are 
      rarely routinely applied in clinical settings. Recent advances in natural language 
      processing techniques allow us to extract such information from unstructured 
      portions of text at a large scale and in a cost effective manner. We aimed to 
      identify cognitive problems in the clinical records of a large sample of patients 
      with schizophrenia, and assess their association with clinical outcomes. Methods: We 
      developed a natural language processing based application identifying cognitive 
      dysfunctions from the free text of medical records, and assessed its performance 
      against a rating scale widely used in the United Kingdom, the cognitive component of 
      the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS). Furthermore, we analyzed cognitive 
      trajectories over the course of patient treatment, and evaluated their relationship 
      with various socio-demographic factors and clinical outcomes. Results: We found a 
      high prevalence of cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia, and a 
      strong correlation with several socio-demographic factors (gender, education, 
      ethnicity, marital status, and employment) as well as adverse clinical outcomes. 
      Results obtained from the free text were broadly in line with those obtained using 
      the HoNOS subscale, and shed light on additional associations, notably related to 
      attention and social impairments for patients with higher education. Conclusions: 
      Our findings demonstrate that cognitive problems are common in patients with 
      schizophrenia, can be reliably extracted from clinical records using natural 
      language processing, and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Harvesting 
      the free text from medical records provides a larger coverage in contrast to 
      neurocognitive batteries or rating scales, and access to additional 
      socio-demographic and clinical variables. Text mining tools can therefore facilitate 
      large scale patient screening and early symptoms detection, and ultimately help 
      inform clinical decisions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The use of clinically derived data from electronic health records 
      (EHRs) and other electronic clinical systems can greatly facilitate clinical 
      research as well as operational and quality initiatives. One approach for making 
      these data available is to incorporate data from different sources into a joint data 
      warehouse. When using such a data warehouse, it is important to understand the 
      quality of the data. The primary objective of this study was to determine the 
      completeness and concordance of common types of clinical data available in the 
      Knowledge Program (KP) joint data warehouse, which contains feeds from several 
      electronic systems including the EHR. METHODS: A manual review was performed of 
      specific data elements for 250 patients from an EHR, and these were compared with 
      corresponding elements in the KP data warehouse. Completeness and concordance were 
      calculated for five categories of data including demographics, vital signs, 
      laboratory results, diagnoses, and medications. RESULTS: In general, data elements 
      for demographics, vital signs, diagnoses, and laboratory results were present in 
      more cases in the source EHR compared to the KP. When data elements were available 
      in both sources, there was a high concordance. In contrast, the KP data warehouse 
      documented a higher prevalence of deaths and medications compared to the EHR. 
      DISCUSSION: Several factors contributed to the discrepancies between data in the KP 
      and the EHR-including the start date and frequency of data feeds updates into the 
      KP, inability to transfer data located in nonstructured formats (e.g., free text or 
      scanned documents), as well as incomplete and missing data variables in the source 
      EHR. CONCLUSION: When evaluating the quality of a data warehouse with multiple data 
      sources, assessing completeness and concordance between data set and source data may 
      be better than designating one to be a gold standard. This will allow the user to 
      optimize the method and timing of data transfer in order to capture data with better 
      accuracy.

TI  - Practicing Clinicians' Recommendations to Reduce Burden from the Electronic Health 
      Record Inbox: a Mixed-Methods Study.
PG  - 1825-1832
LID - 10.1007/s11606-019-05112-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Workload from electronic health record (EHR) inbox notifications leads 
      to information overload and contributes to job dissatisfaction and physician 
      burnout. Better understanding of physicians' inbox requirements and workflows could 
      optimize inbox designs, enhance efficiency, and reduce safety risks from information 
      overload. DESIGN: We conducted a mixed-methods study to identify strategies to 
      enhance EHR inbox design and workflow. First, we performed a secondary analysis of 
      national survey data of all Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care 
      practitioners (PCP) to identify major themes in responses to a free-text question 
      soliciting suggestions to improve EHR inbox design and workflows. We then conducted 
      expert interviews of clinicians at five health care systems (1 VA and 4 non-VA 
      settings using 4 different EHRs) to understand existing optimal strategies to 
      improve efficiency and situational awareness related to EHR inbox use. Themes from 
      survey data were cross-validated with interview findings. RESULTS: We analyzed 
      responses from 2104 PCPs who completed the free-text inbox question (of 5001 PCPs 
      who responded to survey) and used an inductive approach to identify five themes: (1) 
      Inbox notification content should be actionable for patient care and relevant to 
      recipient clinician, (2) Inboxes should reduce risk of losing messages, (3) Inbox 
      functionality should be optimized to improve efficiency of processing notifications, 
      (4) Team support should be leveraged to help with EHR inbox notification burden, (5) 
      Sufficient time should be provided to all clinicians to process EHR inbox 
      notifications. We subsequently interviewed 15 VA and non-VA clinicians and 
      identified 11 unique strategies, each corresponding directly with one of these five 
      themes. CONCLUSION: Feedback from practicing end-user clinicians provides robust 
      evidence to improve content and design of the EHR inbox and related clinical 
      workflows and organizational policies. Several strategies we identified could 
      improve clinicians' EHR efficiency and satisfaction as well as empower them to work 
      with their local administrators, health IT personnel, and EHR developers to improve 
      these systems.

TI  - De-identifying an EHR database - anonymity, correctness and readability of the 
      medical record.
PG  - 862-6
AB  - Electronic health records (EHR) contain a large amount of structured data and free 
      text. Exploring and sharing clinical data can improve healthcare and facilitate the 
      development of medical software. However, revealing confidential information is 
      against ethical principles and laws. We de-identified a Danish EHR database with 
      437,164 patients. The goal was to generate a version with real medical records, but 
      related to artificial persons. We developed a de-identification algorithm that uses 
      lists of named entities, simple language analysis, and special rules. Our algorithm 
      consists of 3 steps: collect lists of identifiers from the database and external 
      resources, define a replacement for each identifier, and replace identifiers in 
      structured data and free text. Some patient records could not be safely 
      de-identified, so the de-identified database has 323,122 patient records with an 
      acceptable degree of anonymity, readability and correctness (F-measure of 95%). The 
      algorithm has to be adjusted for each culture, language and database.

AB  - Chaplaincy care is different for every patient; a growing challenge is to ensure 
      that electronic health records function to support personalized care. While ICU 
      health care teams have advanced clinical practice guidelines to identify and 
      integrate relevant aspects of the patient's story into whole person care, 
      recommendations for documentation are rare. This qualitative study of over 400 
      free-text EHR notes offers unique insight into current use of free-text 
      documentation in ICU by six chaplains integrated into the healthcare team. Our 
      research provides insight into the phenomena chaplains record in the electronic 
      record. Content analysis shows recurrent report of patient and family practices, 
      beliefs, coping mechanisms, concerns, emotional resources and needs, family and 
      faith support, medical decision making and medical communications. These findings 
      are important for health care team discussions of factors deemed essential to whole 
      person care in ICUs, and, by extension have the potential to support the development 
      of EHR designs that aim to advance personalized care.

AB  - CONTEXT: Clinicians document cancer patients' symptoms in free-text format within 
      electronic health record visit notes. Although symptoms are critically important to 
      quality of life and often herald clinical status changes, computational methods to 
      assess the trajectory of symptoms over time are woefully underdeveloped. OBJECTIVES: 
      To create machine learning algorithms capable of extracting patient-reported 
      symptoms from free-text electronic health record notes. METHODS: The data set 
      included 103,564 sentences obtained from the electronic clinical notes of 2695 
      breast cancer patients receiving paclitaxel-containing chemotherapy at two academic 
      cancer centers between May 1996 and May 2015. We manually annotated 10,000 sentences 
      and trained a conditional random field model to predict words indicating an active 
      symptom (positive label), absence of a symptom (negative label), or no symptom at 
      all (neutral label). Sentences labeled by human coder were divided into training, 
      validation, and test data sets. Final model performance was determined on 20% test 
      data unused in model development or tuning. RESULTS: The final model achieved 
      precision of 0.82, 0.86, and 0.99 and recall of 0.56, 0.69, and 1.00 for positive, 
      negative, and neutral symptom labels, respectively. The most common positive 
      symptoms were pain, fatigue, and nausea. Machine-based labeling of 103,564 sentences 
      took two minutes. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the potential of machine learning to 
      gather, track, and analyze symptoms experienced by cancer patients during 
      chemotherapy. Although our initial model requires further optimization to improve 
      the performance, further model building may yield machine learning methods suitable 
      to be deployed in routine clinical care, quality improvement, and research 
      applications.

PG  - 98-102
LID - 10.3233/SHTI200130 [doi]
AB  - Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a long-term illness with a wide range of symptoms 
      and condition trajectories. To improve the understanding of these, automated 
      analysis of large amounts of patient data holds promise. Routinely documented 
      assessments are useful for large-scale analysis, however relevant information is 
      mainly in free text. As a first step to extract symptom and condition trajectories, 
      natural language processing (NLP) methods are useful to identify important textual 
      content and relevant information. In this paper, we propose an agnostic NLP method 
      of extracting segments of patients' clinical histories in CFS assessments. Moreover, 
      we present initial results on the advantage of using these segments to quantify and 
      analyse the presence of certain clinically relevant concepts.

TI  - Utilizing a Prototype Patient-Controlled Electronic Health Record in Germany: 
      Qualitative Analysis of User-Reported Perceptions and Perspectives.
PG  - e10411
LID - 10.2196/10411 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Personal electronic health records (PHR) are considered instrumental in 
      improving health care quality and efficiency, enhancing communication between all 
      parties involved and strengthening the patient's role. Technical architectures, data 
      privacy, and applicability issues have been discussed for many years. Nevertheless, 
      nationwide implementation of a PHR is still pending in Germany despite legal 
      regulations provided by the eHealth Act passed in 2015. Within the information 
      technology for patient-oriented care project funded by the Federal Ministry of 
      Education and Research (2012-2017), a Web-based personal electronic health record 
      prototype (PEPA) was developed enabling patient-controlled information exchange 
      across different care settings. Gastrointestinal cancer patients and general 
      practitioners utilized PEPA during a 3-month trial period. Both patients and 
      physicians authorized by them could view PEPA content online and upload or download 
      files. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to outline findings of the posttrial qualitative 
      study carried out to evaluate user-reported experiences, perceptions, and 
      perspectives, focusing on their interpretation of PEPA beyond technical usability 
      and views on a future nationwide implementation. METHODS: Data were collected 
      through semistructured guide-based interviews with 11 patients and 3 physicians 
      (N=14). Participants were asked to share experiences, views of perceived 
      implications, and perspectives towards nationwide implementation. Further data were 
      generated through free-text fields in a subsequent study-specific patient 
      questionnaire and researcher's notes. Data were pseudonymized, audiotaped, and 
      transcribed verbatim. Content analysis was performed through the Framework Analysis 
      approach. All qualitative data were systemized by using MAXQDA Analytics PRO 12 
      (Rel.12.3.1). Additionally, participant characteristics were analyzed descriptively 
      using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 24. RESULTS: Users interpreted PEPA as a central 
      medium containing digital chronological health-related documentation that simplifies 
      information sharing across care settings. While patients consider the implementation 
      of PEPA in Germany in the near future, physicians are more hesitant. Both groups 
      believe in PEPA's concept, but share awareness of concerns about data privacy and 
      older or impaired people's abilities to manage online records. Patients perceive 
      benefits for involvement in treatment processes and continuity of care but worry 
      about financing and the implementation of functionally reduced versions. Physicians 
      consider integration into primary systems critical for interoperability but 
      anticipate technical challenges, as well as resistance from older patients and 
      colleagues. They omit clear positioning regarding PEPA's potential incremental value 
      for health care organizations or the provider-patient relationship. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Digitalization in German health care will continue to bring change, both 
      organizational and in the physician-patient relationship. Patients endorse and 
      expect a nationwide PEPA implementation, anticipating various benefits. Decision 
      makers and providers need to contribute to closing modernization gaps by committing 
      to new concepts and by invigorating transformed roles.

TI  - Extraction of Temporal Structures for Clinical Events in Unlabeled Free-Text 
      Electronic Health Records in Russian.
PG  - 55-56
LID - 10.3233/SHTI210811 [doi]
AB  - The important information about a patient is often stored in a free-form text to 
      describe the events in the patient's medical history. In this work, we propose and 
      evaluate a hybrid approach based on rules and syntactical analysis to normalise 
      temporal expressions and assess uncertainty depending on the remoteness of the 
      event. A dataset of 500 sentences was manually labelled to measure the accuracy. On 
      this dataset, the accuracy of extracting temporal expressions is 95,5%, and the 
      accuracy of normalization is 94%. The event extraction accuracy is 74.80%. The 
      essential advantage of this work is the implementation of the considered approach 
      for the non-English language where NLP tools are limited.

TI  - An electronic documentation system improves the quality of admission notes: a 
      randomized trial.
PG  - 123-129
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocw064 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There are concerns that structured electronic documentation systems can 
      limit expressivity and encourage long and unreadable notes. We assessed the impact 
      of an electronic clinical documentation system on the quality of admission notes for 
      patients admitted to a general medical unit. METHODS: This was a prospective 
      randomized crossover study comparing handwritten paper notes to electronic notes on 
      different patients by the same author, generated using a semistructured electronic 
      admission documentation system over a 2-month period in 2014. The setting was a 
      4-team, 80-bed general internal medicine clinical teaching unit at a large urban 
      academic hospital. The quality of clinical documentation was assessed using the 
      QNOTE instrument (best possible score = 100), and word counts were assessed for 
      free-text sections of notes. RESULTS: Twenty-one electronic-paper note pairs (42 
      notes) written by 21 authors were randomly drawn from a pool of 303 eligible notes. 
      Overall note quality was significantly higher in electronic vs paper notes (mean 90 
      vs 69, P < .0001). The quality of free-text subsections (History of Present Illness 
      and Impression and Plan) was significantly higher in the electronic vs paper notes 
      (mean 93 vs 78, P < .0001; and 89 vs 77, P = .001, respectively). The History of 
      Present Illness subsection was significantly longer in electronic vs paper notes 
      (mean 172.4 vs 92.4 words, P = .0001). CONCLUSIONS: An electronic admission 
      documentation system improved both the quality of free-text content and the overall 
      quality of admission notes. Authors wrote more in the free-text sections of 
      electronic documents as compared to paper versions.

TI  - Characterizing employment of colorectal cancer survivors using electronic health 
      records.
PG  - ooab061

LID - ooab061
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although the value of collecting occupational data is well-established, 
      these data are not systematically collected in clinical practice. We assessed the 
      availability of electronic health record (EHR)-based occupation data within a large 
      integrated health care system to determine the feasibility of its use in research. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a mixed-methods approach to extract EHR data and 
      define employment status, employer, and employment industry of 1107 colorectal 
      cancer survivors. This was a secondary analysis of a subset of the Patient Outcomes 
      Research to Advance Learning (PORTAL) colorectal cancer cohort. RESULTS: We 
      categorized the employment industry for 46% of the cohort. Employment status was 
      available for 58% of the cohort. The employer was missing for over 95% of the 
      cohort. CONCLUSION: By combining data from structured and free-text EHR fields, we 
      identified employment status and industry for approximately half of our sample. 
      Findings demonstrate limitations of EHR data and underscore the need for systematic 
      collection of occupation data in clinical practice.

TI  - The benefits and risks of structuring and coding of patient histories in the 
      electronic clinical record: protocol for a systematic review.
PG  - 197-203
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data in medical records have in part been recorded in structured and 
      coded forms for some decades. However, the patient history is as yet largely 
      recorded in an uncoded format. There is a need to consider the optimal balance of 
      use of free text and coded data in the patient history. This review protocol 
      summarises our plans to identify, critically appraise and synthesise evidence 
      relating to approaches taken to introduce structure and coding within patient 
      histories in electronic health records, and the empirically demonstrated benefits 
      and risks of structuring and coding of patient histories in health records. 
      OBJECTIVES: To determine how structured and coded data are being introduced for the 
      recording of patient histories, the benefits observed where structuring and coding 
      have been introduced and the risks encountered when structuring and coding are 
      introduced. METHODS: We will search the following databases for evidence of 
      published and unpublished material: CINAHL; EMBASE; Google Scholar; IndMED; LILACS; 
      MEDLINE; NIHR; Paklit and PsycINFO. We will, depending on the study designs 
      employed, use the Cochrane EPOC, Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and Newcastle-Ottawa 
      instruments to critically appraise studies. Data synthesis is likely to be 
      undertaken using a narrative approach, although meta-analysis will also be 
      undertaken if appropriate and if the data allow this. RESULTS: This protocol should 
      represent a reproducible approach to reviewing the literature regarding structuring 
      and coding in patient histories. We anticipate that we will be able to report 
      results in early 2011. CONCLUSION: The review should offer increased clarity and 
      direction on the optimal balance between structuring/coding and free text recording 
      of data relating to the patient history.

TI  - Development of an electronic breast pathology database in a community health system.
PG  - 26
LID - 10.4103/2153-3539.137730 [doi]
LID - 26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care systems rely on electronic patient data, yet access to 
      breast tissue pathology results continues to depend on interpreting dictated 
      free-text reports. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop a method to 
      electronically search and categorize pathologic diagnoses of patients' breast tissue 
      specimens from dictated free-text pathology reports in a large health system for 
      multiple users including clinicians. DESIGN: A database integrating existing 
      patient-level administrative and clinical information for breast cancer screening 
      and diagnostic services and a web-based application for comprehensive searching of 
      pathology reports were developed by a health system team led by pathologists. The 
      Breast Pathology Assessment Tool and Hierarchy for Diagnosis (BPATH-Dx) provided 
      search terms and guided electronic transcription of diagnoses from text fields on 
      breast pathology clinical reports to standardized categories. APPROACH: Breast 
      pathology encounters in the pathology database were matched with administrative data 
      for 7332 women with breast tissue specimens obtained from an initial procedure in 
      the health system from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2011. Sequential queries of 
      the pathology text based on BPATH-Dx categorized biopsies according to their worst 
      pathological diagnosis, as is standard practice. Diagnoses ranged from invasive 
      breast cancer (23.3%), carcinoma in situ (7.8%), atypical lesions (6.39%), 
      proliferative lesions without atypia (27.9%), and nonproliferative lesions (34.7%), 
      and were further classified into subcategories. A random sample of 5% of reports 
      that were manually reviewed indicated 97.5% agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential 
      queries of free-text pathology reports guided by a standardized assessment tool in 
      conjunction with a web-based search application provide an efficient and 
      reproducible approach to accessing nonmalignant breast pathology diagnoses. This 
      method advances the use of pathology data and electronic health records to improve 
      health care quality, patient care, outcomes, and research.

TI  - Quality and Variability of Patient Directions in Electronic Prescriptions in the 
      Ambulatory Care Setting.
PG  - 691-699
LID - 10.18553/jmcp.2018.17404 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prescriber's directions to the patient (Sig) are one of the most 
      quality-sensitive components of a prescription order. Owing to their free-text 
      format, the Sig data that are transmitted in electronic prescriptions 
      (e-prescriptions) have the potential to produce interpretation challenges at 
      receiving pharmacies that may threaten patient safety and also negatively affect 
      medication labeling and patient counseling. Ensuring that all data transmitted in 
      the e-prescription are complete and unambiguous is essential for minimizing 
      disruptions in workflow at prescribers' offices and receiving pharmacies and 
      optimizing the safety and effectiveness of patient care. OBJECTIVES: To (a) assess 
      the quality and variability of free-text Sig strings in ambulatory e-prescriptions 
      and (b) propose best-practice recommendations to improve the use of this 
      quality-sensitive field. METHODS: A retrospective qualitative analysis was performed 
      on a nationally representative sample of 25,000 e-prescriptions issued by 22,152 
      community-based prescribers across the United States using 501 electronic health 
      records (EHRs) or e-prescribing software applications. The content of Sig text 
      strings in e-prescriptions was classified according to a Sig classification scheme 
      developed with guidance from an expert advisory panel. The Sig text strings were 
      also analyzed for quality-related events (QREs). For purposes of this analysis, QREs 
      were defined as Sig text content that could impair accurate and unambiguous 
      interpretation by staff at receiving pharmacies. RESULTS: A total of 3,797 unique 
      Sig concepts were identified in the 25,000 Sig text strings analyzed; more than 50% 
      of all Sigs could be categorized into 25 unique Sig concepts. Even Sig strings that 
      expressed apparently simple and straightforward concepts displayed substantial 
      variability; for example, the sample contained 832 permutations of words and phrases 
      used to convey the Sig concept of "Take 1 tablet by mouth once daily." Approximately 
      10% of Sigs contained QREs that could pose patient safety risks or workflow 
      disruptions that could necessitate pharmacist callbacks to prescribers for 
      clarification or other manual interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of free-text 
      patient directions in e-prescriptions can vary dramatically. However, more than half 
      of all patient directions sent in the ambulatory setting can be categorized into 
      only 25 Sig concepts. This suggests an immediate, practical opportunity to improve 
      patient safety and workflow efficiency for both prescribers and pharmacies. 
      Recommendations include implementing enhancements to Sig creation tools in 
      e-prescribing and EHR software applications, adoption of the Structured and Codified 
      Sig format supported by the current national e-prescribing standard, and improved 
      usability testing and end-user training for generating complete and unambiguous 
      patient directions. Such quality improvements are essential for optimizing the 
      safety and effectiveness of patient care as well as for minimizing workflow 
      disruptions to both prescribers and pharmacies. DISCLOSURES: This research received 
      no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or 
      not-for-profit sectors. Yang, Ward-Charlerie, Dhavle, and Green are employed by

TI  - Contribution of Free-Text Comments to the Burden of Documentation: Assessment and 
      Analysis of Vital Sign Comments in Flowsheets.
PG  - e22806
LID - 10.2196/22806 [doi]
LID - e22806
AB  - BACKGROUND: Documentation burden is a common problem with modern electronic health 
      record (EHR) systems. To reduce this burden, various recording methods (eg, voice 
      recorders or motion sensors) have been proposed. However, these solutions are in an 
      early prototype phase and are unlikely to transition into practice in the near 
      future. A more pragmatic alternative is to directly modify the implementation of the 
      existing functionalities of an EHR system. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the 
      nature of free-text comments entered into EHR flowsheets that supplement 
      quantitative vital sign values and examine opportunities to simplify functionality 
      and reduce documentation burden. METHODS: We evaluated 209,055 vital sign comments 
      in flowsheets that were generated in the Epic EHR system at the Vanderbilt 
      University Medical Center in 2018. We applied topic modeling, as well as the natural 
      language processing Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing software 
      system, to extract generally discussed topics and detailed medical terms (expressed 
      as probability distribution) to investigate the stories communicated in these 
      comments. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that 63.33% (6053/9557) of the users who 
      entered vital signs made at least one free-text comment in vital sign flowsheet 
      entries. The user roles that were most likely to compose comments were registered 
      nurse, technician, and licensed nurse. The most frequently identified topics were 
      the notification of a result to health care providers (0.347), the context of a 
      measurement (0.307), and an inability to obtain a vital sign (0.224). There were 
      4187 unique medical terms that were extracted from 46,029 (0.220) comments, 
      including many symptom-related terms such as "pain," "upset," "dizziness," 
      "coughing," "anxiety," "distress," and "fever" and drug-related terms such as 
      "tylenol," "anesthesia," "cannula," "oxygen," "motrin," "rituxan," and "labetalol." 
      CONCLUSIONS: Considering that flowsheet comments are generally not displayed or 
      automatically pulled into any clinical notes, our findings suggest that the 
      flowsheet comment functionality can be simplified (eg, via structured response 
      fields instead of a text input dialog) to reduce health care provider effort. 
      Moreover, rich and clinically important medical terms such as medications and 
      symptoms should be explicitly recorded in clinical notes for better visibility.

TI  - Coding Free-Text Chief Complaints from a Health Information Exchange: A Preliminary 
      Study.
PG  - 638-647
AB  - Chief complaints are important textual data that can serve to enrich diagnosis and 
      symptom data in electronic health record (EHR) systems. In this study, a method is 
      presented to preprocess chief complaints and assign corresponding ICD-10-CM codes 
      using the MetaMap natural language processing (NLP) system and Unified Medical 
      Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. An exploratory analysis was conducted using a 
      set of 7,942 unique chief complaints from the statewide health information exchange 
      containing EHR data from hospitals across Rhode Island. An evaluation of the 
      proposed method was then performed using a set of 123,086 chief complaints with 
      corresponding ICD-10-CM encounter diagnoses. With 87.82% of MetaMap-extracted 
      concepts correctly assigned, the preliminary findings support the potential use of 
      the method explored in this study for improving upon existing NLP techniques for 
      enabling use of data captured within chief complaints to support clinical care, 
      research, and public health surveillance.

TI  - Validation of the Total Visual Acuity Extraction Algorithm (TOVA) for Automated 
      Extraction of Visual Acuity Data From Free Text, Unstructured Clinical Records.
PG  - 2
LID - 10.1167/tvst.6.2.2 [doi]
LID - 2
AB  - PURPOSE: With increasing volumes of electronic health record data, algorithm-driven 
      extraction may aid manual extraction. Visual acuity often is extracted manually in 
      vision research. The total visual acuity extraction algorithm (TOVA) is presented 
      and validated for automated extraction of visual acuity from free text, unstructured 
      clinical notes. METHODS: Consecutive inpatient ophthalmology notes over an 8-year 
      period from the University of Washington healthcare system in Seattle, WA were used 
      for validation of TOVA. The total visual acuity extraction algorithm applied natural 
      language processing to recognize Snellen visual acuity in free text notes and assign 
      laterality. The best corrected measurement was determined for each eye and converted 
      to logMAR. The algorithm was validated against manual extraction of a subset of 
      notes. RESULTS: A total of 6266 clinical records were obtained giving 12,452 data 
      points. In a subset of 644 validated notes, comparison of manually extracted data 
      versus TOVA output showed 95% concordance. Interrater reliability testing gave κ 
      statistics of 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-0.99), 0.96 (95% CI, 
      0.94-0.98), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92-0.98), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90-0.98) for acuity 
      numerators, denominators, adjustments, and signs, respectively. Pearson correlation 
      coefficient was 0.983. Linear regression showed an R(2) of 0.966 (P < 0.0001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The total visual acuity extraction algorithm is a novel tool for 
      extraction of visual acuity from free text, unstructured clinical notes and provides 
      an open source method of data extraction. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Automated visual 
      acuity extraction through natural language processing can be a valuable tool for 
      data extraction from free text ophthalmology notes.

TI  - Automated identification of drug and food allergies entered using non-standard 
      terminology.
PG  - 962-8
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2013-001756 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: An accurate computable representation of food and drug allergy is 
      essential for safe healthcare. Our goal was to develop a high-performance, easily 
      maintained algorithm to identify medication and food allergies and sensitivities 
      from unstructured allergy entries in electronic health record (EHR) systems. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: An algorithm was developed in Transact-SQL to identify 
      ingredients to which patients had allergies in a perioperative information 
      management system. The algorithm used RxNorm and natural language processing 
      techniques developed on a training set of 24 599 entries from 9445 records. 
      Accuracy, specificity, precision, recall, and F-measure were determined for the 
      training dataset and repeated for the testing dataset (24 857 entries from 9430 
      records). RESULTS: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure for medication allergy 
      matches were all above 98% in the training dataset and above 97% in the testing 
      dataset for all allergy entries. Corresponding values for food allergy matches were 
      above 97% and above 93%, respectively. Specificities of the algorithm were 90.3% and 
      85.0% for drug matches and 100% and 88.9% for food matches in the training and 
      testing datasets, respectively. DISCUSSION: The algorithm had high performance for 
      identification of medication and food allergies. Maintenance is practical, as 
      updates are managed through upload of new RxNorm versions and additions to companion 
      database tables. However, direct entry of codified allergy information by providers 
      (through autocompleters or drop lists) is still preferred to post-hoc encoding of 
      the data. Data tables used in the algorithm are available for download. CONCLUSIONS: 
      A high performing, easily maintained algorithm can successfully identify medication 
      and food allergies from free text entries in EHR systems.

AB  - CONTEXT: For patients with cancer, uncontrolled pain and other symptoms are the 
      leading cause of unplanned hospitalizations. Early access to specialty palliative 
      care (PC) is effective to reduce symptom burden, but more efficient approaches are 
      needed for rapid identification and referral. Information on symptom burden largely 
      exists in free-text notes, limiting its utility as a trigger for best practice 
      alerts or automated referrals. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether natural language 
      processing (NLP) can be used to identify uncontrolled symptoms (pain, dyspnea, or 
      nausea/vomiting) in the electronic health record (EHR) among hospitalized cancer 
      patients with advanced disease. METHODS: The dataset included 1,644 hospitalization 
      encounters for cancer patients admitted from 1/2017 -6/2019. We randomly sampled 296 
      encounters, which included 15,580 clinical notes. We manually reviewed the notes and 
      recorded symptom severity. The primary endpoint was an indicator for whether a 
      symptom was labeled as "controlled" (none, mild, not reported) or as "uncontrolled" 
      (moderate or severe). We randomly split the data into training and test sets and 
      used the Random Forest algorithm to evaluate final model performance. RESULTS: Our 
      models predicted presence of an uncontrolled symptom with the following performance: 
      pain with 61% accuracy, 69% sensitivity, and 46% specificity (F1: 69.5); 
      nausea/vomiting with 68% accuracy, 21% sensitivity, and 90% specificity (F1: 29.4); 
      and dyspnea with 80% accuracy, 22% sensitivity, and 88% specificity (F1: 21.1). 
      CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated initial feasibility of using NLP to identify 
      hospitalized cancer patients with uncontrolled symptoms. Further model development 
      is needed before these algorithms could be implemented to trigger early access to 
      PC.

PG  - 484-494
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1731002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate (1) why ordering clinicians use 
      free-text orders to communicate medication information; (2) what risks physicians 
      and nurses perceive when free-text orders are used for communicating medication 
      information; and (3) how electronic health records (EHRs) could be improved to 
      encourage the safe communication of medication information. METHODS: We performed 
      semi-structured, scenario-based interviews with eight physicians and eight nurses. 
      Interview responses were analyzed and grouped into common themes. RESULTS: 
      Participants described eight reasons why clinicians use free-text medication orders, 
      five risks relating to the use of free-text medication orders, and five 
      recommendations for improving EHR medication-related communication. Poor usability, 
      including reduced efficiency and limited functionality associated with structured 
      order entry, was the primary reason clinicians used free-text orders to communicate 
      medication information. Common risks to using free-text orders for medication 
      communication included the increased likelihood of missing orders and the increased 
      workload on nurses responsible for executing orders. DISCUSSION: Clinicians' use of 
      free-text orders is primarily due to limitations in the current structured order 
      entry design. To encourage the safe communication of medication information between 
      clinicians, the EHR's structured order entry must be redesigned to support 
      clinicians' cognitive and workflow needs that are currently being addressed via the 
      use of free-text orders. CONCLUSION: Clinicians' use of free-text orders as a 
      workaround to insufficient structured order entry can create unintended patient 
      safety risks. Thoughtful solutions designed to address these workarounds can improve 
      the medication ordering process and the subsequent medication administration 
      process.

TI  - Assessing the Performance of Clinical Natural Language Processing Systems: 
      Development of an Evaluation Methodology.
PG  - e20492
LID - 10.2196/20492 [doi]
LID - e20492
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical natural language processing (cNLP) systems are of crucial 
      importance due to their increasing capability in extracting clinically important 
      information from free text contained in electronic health records (EHRs). The 
      conversion of a nonstructured representation of a patient's clinical history into a 
      structured format enables medical doctors to generate clinical knowledge at a level 
      that was not possible before. Finally, the interpretation of the insights gained 
      provided by cNLP systems has a great potential in driving decisions about clinical 
      practice. However, carrying out robust evaluations of those cNLP systems is a 
      complex task that is hindered by a lack of standard guidance on how to 
      systematically approach them. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to offer natural language 
      processing (NLP) experts a methodology for the evaluation of cNLP systems to assist 
      them in carrying out this task. By following the proposed phases, the robustness and 
      representativeness of the performance metrics of their own cNLP systems can be 
      assured. METHODS: The proposed evaluation methodology comprised five phases: (1) the 
      definition of the target population, (2) the statistical document collection, (3) 
      the design of the annotation guidelines and annotation project, (4) the external 
      annotations, and (5) the cNLP system performance evaluation. We presented the 
      application of all phases to evaluate the performance of a cNLP system called 
      "EHRead Technology" (developed by Savana, an international medical company), applied 
      in a study on patients with asthma. As part of the evaluation methodology, we 
      introduced the Sample Size Calculator for Evaluations (SLiCE), a software tool that 
      calculates the number of documents needed to achieve a statistically useful and 
      resourceful gold standard. RESULTS: The application of the proposed evaluation 
      methodology on a real use-case study of patients with asthma revealed the benefit of 
      the different phases for cNLP system evaluations. By using SLiCE to adjust the 
      number of documents needed, a meaningful and resourceful gold standard was created. 
      In the presented use-case, using as little as 519 EHRs, it was possible to evaluate 
      the performance of the cNLP system and obtain performance metrics for the primary 
      variable within the expected CIs. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that our evaluation 
      methodology can offer guidance to NLP experts on how to approach the evaluation of 
      their cNLP systems. By following the five phases, NLP experts can assure the 
      robustness of their evaluation and avoid unnecessary investment of human and 
      financial resources. Besides the theoretical guidance, we offer SLiCE as an 
      easy-to-use, open-source Python library.

AB  - Electronic Medical Records (EMR) contain a lot of valuable data about patients, 
      which is however unstructured. There is a lack of labeled medical text data in 
      Russian and there are no tools for automatic annotation. We present an unsupervised 
      approach to medical data annotation. Morphological and syntactical analyses of 
      initial sentences produce syntactic trees, from which similar subtrees are then 
      grouped by Word2Vec and labeled using dictionaries and Wikidata categories. This 
      method can be used to automatically label EMRs in Russian and proposed methodology 
      can be applied to other languages, which lack resources for automatic labeling and 
      domain vocabularies.

TI  - Improving the Utility of Tobacco-Related Problem List Entries Using Natural Language 
      Processing.
PG  - 534-543
AB  - We present findings on using natural language processing to classify tobacco-related 
      entries from problem lists found within patient's electronic health records. Problem 
      lists describe health-related issues recorded during a patient's medical visit; 
      these problems are typically followed up upon during subsequent visits and are 
      updated for relevance or accuracy. The mechanics of problem lists vary across 
      different electronic health record systems. In general, they either manifest as 
      pre-generated generic problems that may be selected from a master list or as text 
      boxes where a healthcare professional may enter free text describing the problem. 
      Using commonly-available natural language processing tools, we classified 
      tobacco-related problems into three classes: active-user, former-user, and non-user; 
      we further demonstrate that rule-based post-processing may significantly increase 
      precision in identifying these classes (+32%, +22%, +35% respectively). We used 
      these classes to generate tobacco time-spans that reconstruct a patient's 
      tobacco-use history and better support secondary data analysis. We bundle this as an 
      open-source toolkit with flow visualizations indicating how patient tobacco-related 
      behavior changes longitudinally, which can also capture and visualize contradicting 
      information such as smokers being flagged as having never smoked.

      the data extraction process for the Axon Registry®. METHODS: Data elements were 
      abstracted from electronic health records (EHRs) by an external auditor (IQVIA) 
      using virtual site visits at participating sites. IQVIA independently calculated 
      Axon Registry quality measure performance rates based on American Academy of 
      Neurology measure specifications and logic using Axon Registry data. Agreement 
      between Axon Registry and IQVIA data elements and measure performance rates was 
      calculated. Discordance was investigated to elucidate underlying systemic or 
      idiosyncratic reasons for disagreement. RESULTS: Nine sites (n = 720 patients; n = 
      80 patients per site) with diversity among EHR vendor, practice settings, size, 
      locations, and data transfer method were included. There was variable concordance 
      between the data elements in the Axon Registry and those abstracted independently by 
      IQVIA; high match rates (≥92%) were observed for discrete elements (e.g., 
      demographics); lower match rates (<44%) were observed for elements with free text 
      (e.g., plan of care). Across all measures, there was a 76% patient-level measure 
      performance agreement between Axon Registry and IQVIA (κ = 0.53, p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: There was a range of concordance between data elements and quality 
      measures in the Axon Registry and those independently abstracted and calculated by 
      an independent vendor. Validation of data and processes is important for the Axon 
      Registry as a clinical quality data registry that utilizes automated data extraction 
      methods from the EHR. Implementation of remediation strategies to improve data 
      accuracy will support the ability of the Axon Registry to perform accurate quality 
      reporting.

TI  - Identifying opportunities in EHR to improve the quality of antibiotic allergy data.
PG  - e108-12
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv139 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a growing, global public health crisis, due 
      in large part to the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Understanding medication 
      allergy data and allergy reactions that are documented in electronic health records 
      (EHRs) can help to identify opportunities to improve the quality of documentation of 
      beta-lactam allergies, thus potentially reducing the prescribing of alternative 
      antibiotics. METHODS: Medication allergies and allergy reactions recorded in the EHR 
      for 319 051 patients seen across 32 community health centers were reviewed. Patients 
      with a beta-lactam allergy recorded in their EHR were identified. Free text, as well 
      as standardized allergy and allergy reaction fields, were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 
      patients, 9.1% (n = 29 095) had evidence of a beta-lactam allergy recorded in their 
      EHR. Women, white, and non-Hispanic patients were more likely to have a documented 
      allergy compared to men, black, and Hispanic patients. Among all patients with a 
      documented beta-lactam allergy, 36.2% had an empty or missing allergy reaction 
      description in their EHR. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that current EHR 
      documentation practices among the health centers reviewed do not provide enough 
      information on allergic reactions to allow providers to discern between true 
      allergies and common, but anticipated, drug side effects. Improved EHR documentation 
      guidance, training that reinforces the use of standardized data and more detailed 
      recording of allergic reactions, combined with initiatives to address patient 
      barriers including health literacy, may help to improve the accuracy of drug 
      allergies in patients' records. These initiatives, combined with antimicrobial 
      stewardship programs, can help to reduce inappropriate prescribing of alternative 
      antibiotics when beta-lactam antibiotics are first-line and can be tolerated.

TI  - Provider responses to patients controlling access to their electronic health 
      records: a prospective cohort study in primary care.
PG  - S31-7
LID - 10.1007/s11606-014-3053-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Applying Fair Information Practice principles to electronic health 
      records (EHRs) requires allowing patient control over who views their data. METHODS: 
      We designed a program that captures patients' preferences for provider access to an 
      urban health system's EHR. Patients could allow or restrict providers' access to all 
      data (diagnoses, medications, test results, reports, etc.) or only highly sensitive 
      data (sexually transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, drugs/alcohol, mental or 
      reproductive health). Except for information in free-text reports, we redacted EHR 
      data shown to providers according to patients' preferences. Providers could "break 
      the glass" to display redacted information. We prospectively studied this system in 
      one primary care clinic, noting redactions and when users "broke the glass," and 
      surveyed providers about their experiences and opinions. RESULTS: Eight of nine 
      eligible clinic physicians and all 23 clinic staff participated. All 105 patients 
      who enrolled completed the preference program. Providers did not know which of their 
      patients were enrolled, nor their preferences for accessing their EHRs. During the 
      6-month prospective study, 92 study patients (88 %) returned 261 times, during which 
      providers viewed their EHRs 126 times (48 %). Providers "broke the glass" 102 times, 
      92 times for patients not in the study and ten times for six returning study 
      patients, all of whom had restricted EHR access. Providers "broke the glass" for six 
      (14 %) of 43 returning study patients with redacted data vs. zero among 49 study 
      patients without redactions (p = 0.01). Although 54 % of providers agreed that 
      patients should have control over who sees their EHR information, 58 % believed 
      restricting EHR access could harm provider-patient relationships and 71 % felt 
      quality of care would suffer. CONCLUSIONS: Patients frequently preferred restricting 
      provider access to their EHRs. Providers infrequently overrode patients' preferences 
      to view hidden data. Providers believed that restricting EHR access would adversely 
      impact patient care. Applying Fair Information Practice principles to EHRs will 
      require balancing patient preferences, providers' needs, and health care quality.

TI  - Validating the Access to an Electronic Health Record: Classification and Content 
      Analysis of Access Logs.
PG  - 3-6
AB  - Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have made patient information widely available, 
      allowing health professionals to provide better care. However, information 
      confidentiality is an issue that continually needs to be taken into account. The 
      objective of this study is to describe the implementation of rule-based access 
      permissions to an EHR system. The rules that were implemented were based on a 
      qualitative study. Every time users did not meet the specified requirements, they 
      had to justify access through a pop up window with predetermined options, including 
      a free text option ("other justification"). A secondary analysis of a deidentified 
      database was performed. From a total of 20,540,708 hits on the electronic medical 
      record database, 85% of accesses to the EHR system did not require justification. 
      Content analysis of the "Other Justification" option allowed the identification of 
      new types of access. At the time to justify, however, users may choose the faster or 
      less clicks option to access to EHR, associating the justification of access to the 
      EHR as a barrier.

TI  - Support Vector Feature Selection for Early Detection of Anastomosis Leakage From 
      Bag-of-Words in Electronic Health Records.
PG  - 1404-15
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2014.2361688 [doi]
AB  - The free text in electronic health records (EHRs) conveys a huge amount of clinical 
      information about health state and patient history. Despite a rapidly growing 
      literature on the use of machine learning techniques for extracting this 
      information, little effort has been invested toward feature selection and the 
      features' corresponding medical interpretation. In this study, we focus on the task 
      of early detection of anastomosis leakage (AL), a severe complication after elective 
      surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery, using free text extracted from EHRs. We 
      use a bag-of-words model to investigate the potential for feature selection 
      strategies. The purpose is earlier detection of AL and prediction of AL with data 
      generated in the EHR before the actual complication occur. Due to the high 
      dimensionality of the data, we derive feature selection strategies using the robust 
      support vector machine linear maximum margin classifier, by investigating: 1) a 
      simple statistical criterion (leave-one-out-based test); 2) an intensive-computation 
      statistical criterion (Bootstrap resampling); and 3) an advanced statistical 
      criterion (kernel entropy). Results reveal a discriminatory power for early 
      detection of complications after CRC (sensitivity 100%; specificity 72%). These 
      results can be used to develop prediction models, based on EHR data, that can 
      support surgeons and patients in the preoperative decision making phase.

LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-12-28 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In France, recent developments in healthcare system organization have 
      aimed at strengthening decision-making and action in public health at the regional 
      level. Firstly, the 2004 Public Health Act, by setting 100 national and regional 
      public health targets, introduced an evaluative approach to public health programs 
      at the national and regional levels. Meanwhile, the implementation of regional 
      platforms for managing electronic health records (EHRs) has also been under 
      assessment to coordinate the deployment of this important instrument of care within 
      each geographic area. In this context, the development and implementation of a 
      regional approach to epidemiological data extracted from EHRs are an opportunity 
      that must be seized as soon as possible. Our article addresses certain design and 
      organizational aspects so that the technical requirements for such use are 
      integrated into regional platforms in France. The article will base itself on 
      organization of the Rhône-Alpes regional health platform. DISCUSSION: Different 
      tools being deployed in France allow us to consider the potential of these regional 
      platforms for epidemiology and public health (implementation of a national health 
      identification number and a national information system interoperability framework). 
      The deployment of the Rhône-Alpes regional health platform began in the 2000s in 
      France. By August 2011, 2.6 million patients were identified in this platform. A new 
      development step is emerging because regional decision-makers need to measure 
      healthcare efficiency. To pool heterogeneous information contained in various 
      independent databases, the format, norm and content of the metadata have been 
      defined. Two types of databases will be created according to the nature of the data 
      processed, one for extracting structured data, and the second for extracting 
      non-structured and de-identified free-text documents. SUMMARY: Regional platforms 
      for managing EHRs could constitute an important data source for epidemiological 
      surveillance in the context of epidemic alerts, but also in monitoring a number of 
      indicators of infectious and chronic diseases for which no data are yet available in 
      France.

PG  - 309-15
LID - 10.14236/jhi.v22i2.159 [doi]
AB  - The present-day health data ecosystem comprises a wide array of complex 
      heterogeneous data sources. A wide range of clinical, health care, social and other 
      clinically relevant information are stored in these data sources. These data exist 
      either as structured data or as free-text. These data are generally individual 
      person-based records, but social care data are generally case based and less formal 
      data sources may be shared by groups. The structured data may be organised in a 
      proprietary way or be coded using one-of-many coding, classification or 
      terminologies that have often evolved in isolation and designed to meet the needs of 
      the context that they have been developed. This has resulted in a wide range of 
      semantic interoperability issues that make the integration of data held on these 
      different systems changing. We present semantic interoperability challenges and 
      describe a classification of these. We propose a four-step process and a toolkit for 
      those wishing to work more ontologically, progressing from the identification and 
      specification of concepts to validating a final ontology. The four steps are: (1) 
      the identification and specification of data sources; (2) the conceptualisation of 
      semantic meaning; (3) defining to what extent routine data can be used as a measure 
      of the process or outcome of care required in a particular study or audit and (4) 
      the formalisation and validation of the final ontology. The toolkit is an extension 
      of a previous schema created to formalise the development of ontologies related to 
      chronic disease management. The extensions are focused on facilitating rapid 
      building of ontologies for time-critical research studies.

TI  - Developing a section labeler for clinical documents.
PG  - 636-44
AB  - Natural language processing (NLP) technologies provide an opportunity to extract key 
      patient data from free text documents within the electronic health record (EHR). We 
      are developing a series of components from which to construct NLP pipelines. These 
      pipelines typically begin with a component whose goal is to label sections within 
      medical documents with codes indicating the anticipated semantics of their content. 
      This Clinical Section Labeler prepares the document for further, focused information 
      extraction. Below we describe the evaluation of six algorithms designed for use in a 
      Clinical Section Labeler. These algorithms are trained with N-gram-based feature 
      sets extracted from document sections and the document types. In the evaluation, 6 
      different Bayesian models were trained and used to assign one of 27 different topics 
      to each section. A tree-augmented Bayesian network using the document type and 
      N-grams derived from section headers proved most accurate in assigning individual 
      sections appropriate section topics.

PG  - 1522-1523
LID - 10.3233/SHTI190515 [doi]
AB  - Clinical and pathological stage are defining parameters in oncology, which direct a 
      patient's treatment options and prognosis. Pathology reports contain a wealth of 
      staging information that is not stored in structured form in most electronic health 
      records (EHRs). Therefore, we evaluated three supervised machine learning methods 
      (Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting) to classify free-text 
      pathology reports for prostate cancer into T, N and M stage groups.

TI  - Methods for retrospective detection of drug safety signals and adverse events in 
      electronic general practice records.
PG  - 733-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Examination of clinical data routinely recorded in general practice 
      provides significant opportunities for identifying and quantifying medicine-related 
      adverse events not captured by spontaneous adverse reaction reporting systems. 
      Robust pharmacovigilance methods for detecting and monitoring adverse events due to 
      treatment with new and existing medicines are required to estimate the true extent 
      of adverse events experienced by primary care patients. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the 
      study was to examine evidence of adverse events contained in general practice 
      electronic records and to study observed events related to selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as an example of drug-specific pharmaceutical 
      surveillance achievable with these data. METHODS: Electronic clinical records for a 
      cohort of 338 931 patients consulting from 2002 to 2007 were extracted from the 
      patient management systems of 30 primary care clinics in New Zealand. Medical 
      warnings files, prescription records and free text consultation notes were used to 
      identify physician-recorded treatment cautions, including adverse events and 
      medicines they were associated with. A structured chronological analysis of 
      prescriptions, consultation notes and adverse events relating to patients prescribed 
      the SSRI citalopram was undertaken, and included investigating reasons for switching 
      treatment to another SSRI (fluoxetine or paroxetine) as a method for detecting 
      evidence of drug safety signals. We compared the number of adverse events identified 
      for patients at one practice with the number spontaneously reported to New Zealand's 
      Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring (CARM). RESULTS: During the 6-year study 
      period, 173 478 patients received 4 811 561 prescriptions. There were 37 397 
      allergies, adverse events and other warnings recorded for 24 994 patients (7.4%); 
      adverse events relating to 65 different types of drug were reported. Medicines most 
      frequently implicated in adverse event reports were antibacterials, analgesics, 
      antihypertensive medicines, lipid-modifying agents and skin preparations. Citalopram 
      was prescribed for 5612 patients, and 701 adverse events relating to citalopram were 
      identified in the electronic health records of 473 (8.4%) patients. A total of 713 
      (12.7%) patients changed treatment from citalopram to another SSRI, and 164 reasons 
      for the switch were identified: suspected adverse drug effects for 129 (78.7%), lack 
      of effect for 29 (17.7%) and patient preference for 6 (3.7%). The most common 
      adverse events preceding the switch were anxiety, nausea and headaches. Of the 725 
      adverse events and medical warnings recorded at one practice, 21 (2.9%) were 
      spontaneously reported to the CARM. CONCLUSIONS: Routinely recorded general practice 
      data provide a wealth of opportunities for monitoring drug safety signals and for 
      other patient safety issues. Medical warning records and consultation notes contain 
      a wealth of information on adverse events but structured search methodologies are 
      often required to identify these.

TI  - Process assessment by automated computation of healthcare quality indicators in 
      hospital electronic health records: a systematic review of indicators.
PG  - 867-71
AB  - The objective of the work is to extract healthcare process quality indicators from 
      the literature, and to evaluate which of them could be automatically computed using 
      routinely collected data from electronic health records (EHRs). A minimal set of 
      data commonly available in EHRs is first defined. The initial bibliographic query 
      enables to identify 8,744 papers, among which 126 papers describe 440 process 
      indicators. 22.3% of indicators can be automatically computed. The computation of 
      the indicators mostly require diagnoses (99%), drug prescriptions (59%), medical 
      procedures (48%), administrative data (30%), laboratory results (20%), free-text 
      reports with basic keyword research (19%), linkage with the patient's previous stays 
      (11%) and dependence assessment (3%). 77.7% of indicators cannot be automatically 
      computed, mostly because they require a linkage with outpatient data (61%), 
      structured data that are usually not available (43%), unstructured data (26%) or the 
      trace of an information that was given to the patient (8%).

TI  - An information extraction framework for cohort identification using electronic 
      health records.
PG  - 149-53
AB  - Information extraction (IE), a natural language processing (NLP) task that 
      automatically extracts structured or semi-structured information from free text, has 
      become popular in the clinical domain for supporting automated systems at 
      point-of-care and enabling secondary use of electronic health records (EHRs) for 
      clinical and translational research. However, a high performance IE system can be 
      very challenging to construct due to the complexity and dynamic nature of human 
      language. In this paper, we report an IE framework for cohort identification using 
      EHRs that is a knowledge-driven framework developed under the Unstructured 
      Information Management Architecture (UIMA). A system to extract specific information 
      can be developed by subject matter experts through expert knowledge engineering of 
      the externalized knowledge resources used in the framework.

TI  - Validation of International Classification of Diseases coding for bone metastases in 
      electronic health records using technology-enabled abstraction.
PG  - 441-8
LID - 10.2147/CLEP.S92209 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The accuracy of bone metastases diagnostic coding based on International 
      Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9) is unknown for most large 
      databases used for epidemiologic research in the US. Electronic health records (EHR) 
      are the preferred source of data, but often clinically relevant data occur only as 
      unstructured free text. We examined the validity of bone metastases ICD-9 coding in 
      structured EHR and administrative claims relative to the complete (structured and 
      unstructured) patient chart obtained through technology-enabled chart abstraction. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Female patients with breast cancer with ≥1 visit after 
      November 2010 were identified from three community oncology practices in the US. We 
      calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative 
      predictive value (NPV) of bone metastases ICD-9 code 198.5. The technology-enabled 
      abstraction displays portions of the chart to clinically trained abstractors for 
      targeted review, thereby maximizing efficiency. We evaluated effects of 
      misclassification of patients developing skeletal complications or treated with 
      bone-targeting agents (BTAs), and timing of BTA. RESULTS: Among 8,796 patients with 
      breast cancer, 524 had confirmed bone metastases using chart abstraction. 
      Sensitivity was 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] =0.63-0.71) based on structured 
      EHR, and specificity was high at 0.98 (95% CI =0.98-0.99) with corresponding PPV of 
      0.71 (95% CI =0.67-0.75) and NPV of 0.98 (95% CI =0.98-0.98). From claims, 
      sensitivity was 0.78 (95% CI =0.74-0.81), and specificity was 0.98 (95% CI 
      =0.98-0.98) with PPV of 0.72 (95% CI =0.68-0.76) and NPV of 0.99 (95% CI 
      =0.98-0.99). Structured data and claims missed 17% of bone metastases (89 of 524). 
      False negatives were associated with measurable overestimation of the proportion 
      treated with BTA or with a skeletal complication. Median date of diagnosis was 
      delayed in structured data (32 days) and claims (43 days) compared with 
      technology-assisted EHR. CONCLUSION: Technology-enabled chart abstraction of 
      unstructured EHR greatly improves data quality, minimizing false negatives when 
      identifying patients with bone metastases that may lead to inaccurate conclusions 
      that can affect delivery of care.

TI  - The Feasibility of Using Large-Scale Text Mining to Detect Adverse Childhood 
      Experiences in a VA-Treated Population.
PG  - 505-14
LID - 10.1002/jts.22058 [doi]
AB  - Free text in electronic health records resists large-scale analysis. Text records 
      facts of interest not found in encoded data, and text mining enables their retrieval 
      and quantification. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) clinical data 
      repository affords an opportunity to apply text-mining methodology to study clinical 
      questions in large populations. To assess the feasibility of text mining, 
      investigation of the relationship between exposure to adverse childhood experiences 
      (ACEs) and recorded diagnoses was conducted among all VA-treated Gulf war veterans, 
      utilizing all progress notes recorded from 2000-2011. Text processing extracted ACE 
      exposures recorded among 44.7 million clinical notes belonging to 243,973 veterans. 
      The relationship of ACE exposure to adult illnesses was analyzed using logistic 
      regression. Bias considerations were assessed. ACE score was strongly associated 
      with suicide attempts and serious mental disorders (ORs = 1.84 to 1.97), and less so 
      with behaviorally mediated and somatic conditions (ORs = 1.02 to 1.36) per unit. 
      Bias adjustments did not remove persistent associations between ACE score and most 
      illnesses. Text mining to detect ACE exposure in a large population was feasible. 
      Analysis of the relationship between ACE score and adult health conditions yielded 
      patterns of association consistent with prior research.

TI  - Use and satisfaction with key functions of a common commercial electronic health 
      record: a survey of primary care providers.
PG  - 86
LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-13-86 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite considerable financial incentives for adoption, there is little 
      evidence available about providers' use and satisfaction with key functions of 
      electronic health records (EHRs) that meet "meaningful use" criteria. METHODS: We 
      surveyed primary care providers (PCPs) in 11 general internal medicine and family 
      medicine practices affiliated with 3 health systems in Texas about their use and 
      satisfaction with performing common tasks (documentation, medication prescribing, 
      preventive services, problem list) in the Epic EHR, a common commercial system. Most 
      practices had greater than 5 years of experience with the Epic EHR. We used 
      multivariate logistic regression to model predictors of being a structured 
      documenter, defined as using electronic templates or prepopulated dot phrases to 
      document at least two of the three note sections (history, physical, assessment and 
      plan). RESULTS: 146 PCPs responded (70%). The majority used free text to document 
      the history (51%) and assessment and plan (54%) and electronic templates to document 
      the physical exam (57%). Half of PCPs were structured documenters (55%) with family 
      medicine specialty (adjusted OR 3.3, 95% CI, 1.4-7.8) and years since graduation 
      (nonlinear relationship with youngest and oldest having lowest probabilities) being 
      significant predictors. Nearly half (43%) reported spending at least one extra hour 
      beyond each scheduled half-day clinic completing EHR documentation. Three-quarters 
      were satisfied with documenting completion of pneumococcal vaccinations and half 
      were satisfied with documenting cancer screening (57% for breast, 45% for 
      colorectal, and 46% for cervical). Fewer were satisfied with reminders for overdue 
      pneumococcal vaccination (48%) and cancer screening (38% for breast, 37% for 
      colorectal, and 31% for cervical). While most believed the problem list was helpful 
      (70%) and kept an up-to-date list for their patients (68%), half thought they were 
      unreliable and inaccurate (51%). CONCLUSIONS: Dissatisfaction with and suboptimal 
      use of key functions of the EHR may mitigate the potential for EHR use to improve 
      preventive health and chronic disease management. Future work should optimize use of 
      key functions and improve providers' time efficiency.

TI  - Family member information extraction via neural sequence labeling models with 
      different tag schemes.
PG  - 257
LID - 10.1186/s12911-019-0996-4 [doi]
LID - 257
AB  - BACKGROUND: Family history information (FHI) described in unstructured electronic 
      health records (EHRs) is a valuable information source for patient care and 
      scientific researches. Since FHI is usually described in the format of free text, 
      the entire process of FHI extraction consists of various steps including section 
      segmentation, family member and clinical observation extraction, and relation 
      discovery between the extracted members and their observations. The extraction step 
      involves the recognition of FHI concepts along with their properties such as the 
      family side attribute of the family member concept. METHODS: This study focuses on 
      the extraction step and formulates it as a sequence labeling problem. We employed a 
      neural sequence labeling model along with different tag schemes to distinguish 
      family members and their observations. Corresponding to different tag schemes, the 
      identified entities were aggregated and processed by different algorithms to 
      determine the required properties. RESULTS: We studied the effectiveness of encoding 
      required properties in the tag schemes by evaluating their performance on the 
      dataset released by the BioCreative/OHNLP challenge 2018. It was observed that the 
      proposed side scheme along with the developed features and neural network 
      architecture can achieve an overall F1-score of 0.849 on the test set, which ranked 
      second in the FHI entity recognition subtask. CONCLUSIONS: By comparing with the 
      performance of conditional random fields models, the developed neural network-based 
      models performed significantly better. However, our error analysis revealed two 
      challenging issues of the current approach. One is that some properties required 
      cross-sentence inferences. The other is that the current model is not able to 
      distinguish between the narratives describing the family members of the patient and 
      those specifying the relatives of the patient's family members.

TI  - Extracting Country-of-Origin from Electronic Health Records for Gene- Environment 
      Studies as Part of the Epidemiologic Architecture for Genes Linked to Environment 
      (EAGLE) Study.
PG  - 50-57
AB  - We describe here the extraction of country-of-origin, an acculturation variable 
      relevant for gene-environment studies, in a biorepository linked to de-identified 
      electronic health records (EHRs) assessed by the Epidemiologic Architecture for 
      Genes Linked to Environment (EAGLE), a study site of the Population Architecture 
      using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) I study. We extracted country-of-origin from 
      the unstructured clinical free text using regular expressions within the MySQL 
      relational database system in a cohort of 15,863 subjects of mostly non-European 
      descent (including 11,519 African Americans, 1,702 Hispanics, and 1,118 Asians). We 
      performed searches for 231 world countries (including independent sovereign states, 
      dependent areas, and disputed territories) and common misspellings in >14 gigabytes 
      of data including >13 billion characters of clinical text. Manual review of a 
      fraction of the initial country-of-origin assignments established rules for data 
      cleaning and quality control to achieve final country-of-origin status for each 
      subject. After data cleaning, a total of 1,911/15,893 (12.02%) subjects were 
      assigned to a country-of-origin outside of the United States. Mexico was the most 
      commonly assigned country outside of the United States (264 subjects; 13.8% of 
      subjects with a foreign country-of-origin assignment). The distribution of the 
      countries assigned followed expectations based on known migration patterns to the 
      United States with an emphasis on the southeastern region. These data suggest 
      country-of-origin can be successfully extracted from unstructured clinical text for 
      downstream genetic association studies.

TI  - Automatic detection of inconsistencies between free text and coded data in Sarcoma 
      discharge letters.
PG  - 661-6
AB  - Discordance between data stored in Electronic Health Records (EHR) may have a 
      harmful effect on patient care. Automatic identification of such situations is an 
      important yet challenging task, especially when the discordance involves information 
      stored in free text fields. Here we present a method to automatically detect 
      inconsistencies between data stored in free text and related coded fields. Using EHR 
      data we train an ensemble of classifiers to predict the value of coded fields from 
      the free text fields. Cases in which the classifiers predict with high confidence a 
      code different from the clinicians' choice are marked as potential inconsistencies.

AB  - Controlled clinical trials are usually supported with an in-front data aggregation 
      system, which supports the storage of relevant information according to the trial 
      context within a highly structured environment. In contrast to the documentation of 
      clinical trials, daily routine documentation has many characteristics that influence 
      data quality. One such characteristic is the use of non-standardized text, which is 
      an indispensable part of information representation in clinical information systems. 
      Based on a cohort study we highlight challenges for mining electronic health records 
      targeting free text entry fields within semi-structured data sources. Our 
      prototypical information extraction system achieved an F-measure of 0.91 
      (precision=0.90, recall=0.93) for the training set and an F-measure of 0.90 
      (precision=0.89, recall=0.92) for the test set. We analyze the obtained results in 
      detail and highlight challenges and future directions for the secondary use of 
      routine data in general.

TI  - Knowledge discovery for Deep Phenotyping serious mental illness from Electronic 
      Mental Health records.
PG  - 210

LID - 210
AB  - Background: Deep Phenotyping is the precise and comprehensive analysis of phenotypic 
      features in which the individual components of the phenotype are observed and 
      described. In UK mental health clinical practice, most clinically relevant 
      information is recorded as free text in the Electronic Health Record, and offers a 
      granularity of information beyond what is expressed in most medical knowledge bases. 
      The SNOMED CT nomenclature potentially offers the means to model such information at 
      scale, yet given a sufficiently large body of clinical text collected over many 
      years, it is difficult to identify the language that clinicians favour to express 
      concepts. Methods: By utilising a large corpus of healthcare data, we sought to make 
      use of semantic modelling and clustering techniques to represent the relationship 
      between the clinical vocabulary of internationally recognised SMI symptoms and the 
      preferred language used by clinicians within a care setting. We explore how such 
      models can be used for discovering novel vocabulary relevant to the task of 
      phenotyping Serious Mental Illness (SMI) with only a small amount of prior 
      knowledge.  Results: 20 403 terms were derived and curated via a two stage 
      methodology. The list was reduced to 557 putative concepts based on eliminating 
      redundant information content. These were then organised into 9 distinct categories 
      pertaining to different aspects of psychiatric assessment. 235 concepts were found 
      to be expressions of putative clinical significance. Of these, 53 were identified 
      having novel synonymy with existing SNOMED CT concepts. 106 had no mapping to SNOMED 
      CT. Conclusions: We demonstrate a scalable approach to discovering new concepts of 
      SMI symptomatology based on real-world clinical observation. Such approaches may 
      offer the opportunity to consider broader manifestations of SMI symptomatology than 
      is typically assessed via current diagnostic frameworks, and create the potential 
      for enhancing nomenclatures such as SNOMED CT based on real-world expressions.

TI  - What evidence is there for a delay in diagnostic coding of RA in UK general practice 
      records? An observational study of free text.
PG  - e010393
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010393 [doi]
LID - e010393
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Much research with electronic health records (EHRs) uses coded or 
      structured data only; important information captured in the free text remains 
      unused. One dimension of EHR data quality assessment is 'currency' or timeliness, 
      that is, data are representative of the patient state at the time of measurement. We 
      explored the use of free text in UK general practice patient records to evaluate 
      delays in recording of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosis. We also aimed to locate 
      and quantify disease and diagnostic information recorded only in text. SETTING: UK 
      general practice patient records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. 
      PARTICIPANTS: 294 individuals with incident diagnosis of RA between 2005 and 2008; 
      204 women and 85 men, median age 63 years. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Assessment of (1) quantity and timing of text entries for disease-modifying 
      antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) as a proxy for the RA disease code, and (2) quantity, 
      location and timing of free text information relating to RA onset and diagnosis. 
      RESULTS: Inflammatory markers, pain and DMARDs were the most common categories of 
      disease information in text prior to RA diagnostic code; 10-37% of patients had such 
      information only in text. Read codes associated with RA-related text included 
      correspondence, general consultation and arthritis codes. 64 patients (22%) had 
      DMARD text entries >14 days prior to RA code; these patients had more and earlier 
      referrals to rheumatology, tests, swelling, pain and DMARD prescriptions, suggestive 
      of an earlier implicit diagnosis than was recorded by the diagnostic code. 
      CONCLUSIONS: RA-related symptoms, tests, referrals and prescriptions were recorded 
      in free text with 22% of patients showing strong evidence of delay in coding of 
      diagnosis. Researchers using EHRs may need to mitigate for delayed codes by 
      incorporating text into their case-ascertainment strategies. Natural language 
      processing techniques have the capability to do this at scale.

TI  - Issues in Building a Nursing Home Syndromic Surveillance System with Textmining: 
      Longitudinal Observational Study.
PG  - e69
LID - 10.2196/publichealth.9022 [doi]
LID - e69
AB  - BACKGROUND: New nursing homes (NH) data warehouses fed from residents' medical 
      records allow monitoring the health of elderly population on a daily basis. 
      Elsewhere, syndromic surveillance has already shown that professional data can be 
      used for public health (PH) surveillance but not during a long-term follow-up of the 
      same cohort. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to build and assess a national ecological 
      NH PH surveillance system (SS). METHODS: Using a national network of 126 NH, we 
      built a residents' cohort, extracted medical and personal data from their electronic 
      health records, and transmitted them through the internet to a national server 
      almost in real time. After recording sociodemographic, autonomic and syndromic 
      information, a set of 26 syndromes was defined using pattern matching with the 
      standard query language-LIKE operator and a Delphi-like technique, between November 
      2010 and June 2016. We used early aberration reporting system (EARS) and Bayes 
      surveillance algorithms of the R surveillance package (Höhle) to assess our 
      influenza and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) syndromic data against the Sentinelles 
      network data, French epidemics gold standard, following Centers for Disease Control 
      and Prevention surveillance system assessment guidelines. RESULTS: By extracting all 
      sociodemographic residents' data, a cohort of 41,061 senior citizens was built. 
      EARS_C3 algorithm on NH influenza and AGE syndromic data gave sensitivities of 0.482 
      and 0.539 and specificities of 0.844 and 0.952, respectively, over a 6-year period, 
      forecasting the last influenza outbreak by catching early flu signals. In addition, 
      assessment of influenza and AGE syndromic data quality showed precisions of 0.98 and 
      0.96 during last season epidemic weeks' peaks (weeks 03-2017 and 01-2017) and 
      precisions of 0.95 and 0.92 during last summer epidemic weeks' low (week 33-2016). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that using syndromic information gives a good 
      opportunity to develop a genuine French national PH SS dedicated to senior citizens. 
      Access to senior citizens' free-text validated health data on influenza and AGE 
      responds to a PH issue for the surveillance of this fragile population. This 
      database will also make possible new ecological research on other subjects that will 
      improve prevention, care, and rapid response when facing health threats.

TI  - Transformer-Based Named Entity Recognition for Parsing Clinical Trial Eligibility 
      Criteria.
LID - 49 [pii]
LID - 10.1145/3459930.3469560 [doi]
AB  - The rapid adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) systems has made clinical 
      data available in electronic format for research and for many downstream 
      applications. Electronic screening of potentially eligible patients using these 
      clinical databases for clinical trials is a critical need to improve trial 
      recruitment efficiency. Nevertheless, manually translating free-text eligibility 
      criteria into database queries is labor intensive and inefficient. To facilitate 
      automated screening, free-text eligibility criteria must be structured and coded 
      into a computable format using controlled vocabularies. Named entity recognition 
      (NER) is thus an important first step. In this study, we evaluate 4 state-of-the-art 
      transformer-based NER models on two publicly available annotated corpora of 
      eligibility criteria released by Columbia University (i.e., the Chia data) and 
      Facebook Research (i.e.the FRD data). Four transformer-based models (i.e., BERT, 
      ALBERT, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA) pretrained with general English domain corpora vs. 
      those pretrained with PubMed citations, clinical notes from the MIMIC-III dataset 
      and eligibility criteria extracted from all the clinical trials on 
      ClinicalTrials.gov were compared. Experimental results show that RoBERTa pretrained 
      with MIMIC-III clinical notes and eligibility criteria yielded the highest strict 
      and relaxed F-scores in both the Chia data (i.e., 0.658/0.798) and the FRD data 
      (i.e., 0.785/0.916). With promising NER results, further investigations on building 
      a reliable natural language processing (NLP)-assisted pipeline for automated 
      electronic screening are needed.

TI  - Effect of the Adoption of a Comprehensive Electronic Health Record on Graduate 
      Medical Education: Perceptions of Faculty and Trainees.
PG  - 476-483
LID - 10.14423/SMJ.0000000000000847 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Health systems are adopting electronic health records (EHRs). There are 
      few studies on the effects of EHR implementation on graduate medical education. The 
      authors sought to longitudinally assess perceptions of the impact of EHRs on 
      graduate medical education during implementation and 2 years after implementation. 
      METHODS: A survey was distributed to faculty and trainees during the first year 
      (2013) of adoption of the EHR system. A follow-up survey was distributed 2 years 
      later (2015). The χ(2) test was used to compare the quantitative responses, and 
      factor analysis was conducted to identify correlations between items. Free text 
      responses were analyzed qualitatively. RESULTS: The initial survey (in 2013) 
      included 290 faculty and 106 trainees; the follow-up survey (in 2015) included 353 
      faculty and 226 trainees. In 2013, respondents had a positive impression of EHRs. 
      During the implementation phase, participants believed that face-to-face teaching 
      was negatively affected (P = 0.001). Faculty believed EHRs had a negative effect on 
      trainees' ability to take a history/conduct physical examinations (P = 0.002) and to 
      formulate a differential diagnosis/plan independently (P = 0.003). In 2015, faculty 
      opinions of the impact of the EHR remained unchanged; trainee responses were more 
      positive than in 2013 in some areas. Qualitative analysis showed that the most 
      frequent strategies to enhance the educational process were the development of EHR 
      skills and improved chart access and note assistance. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents 
      remain positive about the EHR 2 years after implementation. Faculty remain concerned 
      about its effect on the educational process, whereas residents appear more positive 
      regarding the potential for EHRs to enhance their education.

TI  - Benchmarking Modern Named Entity Recognition Techniques for Free-text Health Record 
      Deidentification.
PG  - 102-111
AB  - Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become the primary form of medical 
      data-keeping across the United States. Federal law restricts the sharing of any EHR 
      data that contains protected health information (PHI). De-identification, the 
      process of identifying and removing all PHI, is crucial for making EHR data publicly 
      available for scientific research. This project explores several deep learning-based 
      named entity recognition (NER) methods to determine which method(s) perform better 
      on the de-identification task. We trained and tested our models on the i2b2 training 
      dataset, and qualitatively assessed their performance using EHR data collected from 
      a local hospital. We found that 1) Bi-LSTM-CRF represents the best-performing 
      encoder/decoder combination, 2) character-embeddings tend to improve precision at 
      the price of recall, and 3) transformers alone under-perform as context encoders. 
      Future work focused on structuring medical text may improve the extraction of 
      semantic and syntactic information for the purposes of EHR deidentification.

TI  - DEEPEN: A negation detection system for clinical text incorporating dependency 
      relation into NegEx.
PG  - 213-9
LID - S1532-0464(15)00043-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2015.02.010 [doi]
AB  - In Electronic Health Records (EHRs), much of valuable information regarding 
      patients' conditions is embedded in free text format. Natural language processing 
      (NLP) techniques have been developed to extract clinical information from free text. 
      One challenge faced in clinical NLP is that the meaning of clinical entities is 
      heavily affected by modifiers such as negation. A negation detection algorithm, 
      NegEx, applies a simplistic approach that has been shown to be powerful in clinical 
      NLP. However, due to the failure to consider the contextual relationship between 
      words within a sentence, NegEx fails to correctly capture the negation status of 
      concepts in complex sentences. Incorrect negation assignment could cause inaccurate 
      diagnosis of patients' condition or contaminated study cohorts. We developed a 
      negation algorithm called DEEPEN to decrease NegEx's false positives by taking into 
      account the dependency relationship between negation words and concepts within a 
      sentence using Stanford dependency parser. The system was developed and tested using 
      EHR data from Indiana University (IU) and it was further evaluated on Mayo Clinic 
      dataset to assess its generalizability. The evaluation results demonstrate DEEPEN, 
      which incorporates dependency parsing into NegEx, can reduce the number of incorrect 
      negation assignment for patients with positive findings, and therefore improve the 
      identification of patients with the target clinical findings in EHRs.

TI  - An analysis of clinical queries in an electronic health record search utility.
PG  - 515-22
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2010.03.004 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: While search engines have become nearly ubiquitous on the Web, electronic 
      health records (EHRs) generally lack search functionality; furthermore, there is no 
      knowledge on how and what healthcare providers search while using an EHR-based 
      search utility. In this study, we sought to understand user needs as captured by 
      their search queries. METHODS: This post-implementation study analyzed user search 
      log files for 6 months from an EHR-based, free-text search utility at our large 
      academic institution. The search logs were de-identified and then analyzed in two 
      steps. First, two investigators classified all the unique queries as navigational, 
      transactional, or informational searches. Second, three physician reviewers 
      categorized a random sample of 357 informational searches into high-level semantic 
      types derived from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The reviewers were 
      given overlapping data sets, such that two physicians reviewed each query. RESULTS: 
      We analyzed 2207 queries performed by 436 unique users over a 6-month period. Of the 
      2207 queries, 980 were unique queries. Users of the search utility included 
      clinicians, researchers and administrative staff. Across the whole user population, 
      approximately 14.5% of the user searches were navigational searches and 85.1% were 
      informational. Within informational searches, we found that users predominantly 
      searched for laboratory results and specific diseases. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of 
      user types, ranging from clinicians to administrative staff, took advantage of the 
      EHR-based search utility. Though these users' search behavior differed, they 
      predominantly performed informational searches related to laboratory results and 
      specific diseases. Additionally, a number of queries were part of words, implying 
      the need for a free-text module to be included in any future concept-based search 
      algorithm.

TI  - Stroke Outcome Measurements From Electronic Medical Records: Cross-sectional Study 
      on the Effectiveness of Neural and Nonneural Classifiers.
PG  - e29120
LID - 10.2196/29120 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs), there is 
      an ever-increasing opportunity to collect data and extract knowledge from EMRs to 
      support patient-centered stroke management. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare 
      the effectiveness of state-of-the-art automatic text classification methods in 
      classifying data to support the prediction of clinical patient outcomes and the 
      extraction of patient characteristics from EMRs. METHODS: Our study addressed the 
      computational problems of information extraction and automatic text classification. 
      We identified essential tasks to be considered in an ischemic stroke value-based 
      program. The 30 selected tasks were classified (manually labeled by specialists) 
      according to the following value agenda: tier 1 (achieved health care status), tier 
      2 (recovery process), care related (clinical management and risk scores), and 
      baseline characteristics. The analyzed data set was retrospectively extracted from 
      the EMRs of patients with stroke from a private Brazilian hospital between 2018 and 
      2019. A total of 44,206 sentences from free-text medical records in Portuguese were 
      used to train and develop 10 supervised computational machine learning methods, 
      including state-of-the-art neural and nonneural methods, along with ontological 
      rules. As an experimental protocol, we used a 5-fold cross-validation procedure 
      repeated 6 times, along with subject-wise sampling. A heatmap was used to display 
      comparative result analyses according to the best algorithmic effectiveness (F1 
      score), supported by statistical significance tests. A feature importance analysis 
      was conducted to provide insights into the results. RESULTS: The top-performing 
      models were support vector machines trained with lexical and semantic textual 
      features, showing the importance of dealing with noise in EMR textual 
      representations. The support vector machine models produced statistically superior 
      results in 71% (17/24) of tasks, with an F1 score >80% regarding care-related tasks 
      (patient treatment location, fall risk, thrombolytic therapy, and pressure ulcer 
      risk), the process of recovery (ability to feed orally or ambulate and communicate), 
      health care status achieved (mortality), and baseline characteristics (diabetes, 
      obesity, dyslipidemia, and smoking status). Neural methods were largely outperformed 
      by more traditional nonneural methods, given the characteristics of the data set. 
      Ontological rules were also effective in tasks such as baseline characteristics 
      (alcoholism, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease) and the Rankin scale. 
      The complementarity in effectiveness among models suggests that a combination of 
      models could enhance the results and cover more tasks in the future. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Advances in information technology capacity are essential for scalability and 
      agility in measuring health status outcomes. This study allowed us to measure 
      effectiveness and identify opportunities for automating the classification of 
      outcomes of specific tasks related to clinical conditions of stroke victims, and 
      thus ultimately assess the possibility of proactively using these machine learning 
      techniques in real-world situations.

      records: X-linked hypophosphatemia as an example.

AB  - Electronic Health Records (EHRs) represent a source of high value data which is 
      often underutilized because exploiting the information contained therein requires 
      specialized techniques unavailable to the end user i.e. the physician or the 
      investigator. Here I describe four simple and practical avenues that will allow the 
      standard EHR end user to identify patient cohorts: the use of diagnostic codes from 
      different international catalogues; a search in reports from complementary tests 
      (e.g. radiographs or lab tests) for any result of interest; a free text search; or a 
      drug prescription search in the patient's electronic prescription record. This 
      medical approach is acquiring great importance in the field of rare diseases, and 
      here I demonstrate its application with X-linked hypophosphatemia. The use of these 
      four EHR questioning approaches makes finding a cohort of patients of any condition 
      or disease feasible and manageable, and once each case record is checked, a 
      well-defined cohort can be assembled.

      Mining Study.
PG  - e24678
LID - 10.2196/24678 [doi]
LID - e24678
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug prescriptions are often recorded in free-text clinical narratives; 
      making this information available in a structured form is important to support many 
      health-related tasks. Although several natural language processing (NLP) methods 
      have been proposed to extract such information, many challenges remain. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study evaluates the feasibility of using NLP and deep learning approaches for 
      extracting and linking drug names and associated attributes identified in clinical 
      free-text notes and presents an extensive error analysis of different methods. This 
      study initiated with the participation in the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges 
      (n2c2) shared task on adverse drug events and medication extraction. METHODS: The 
      proposed system (DrugEx) consists of a named entity recognizer (NER) to identify 
      drugs and associated attributes and a relation extraction (RE) method to identify 
      the relations between them. For NER, we explored deep learning-based approaches (ie, 
      bidirectional long-short term memory with conditional random fields [BiLSTM-CRFs]) 
      with various embeddings (ie, word embedding, character embedding [CE], and 
      semantic-feature embedding) to investigate how different embeddings influence the 
      performance. A rule-based method was implemented for RE and compared with a 
      context-aware long-short term memory (LSTM) model. The methods were trained and 
      evaluated using the 2018 n2c2 shared task data. RESULTS: The experiments showed that 
      the best model (BiLSTM-CRFs with pretrained word embeddings [PWE] and CE) achieved 
      lenient micro F-scores of 0.921 for NER, 0.927 for RE, and 0.855 for the end-to-end 
      system. NER, which relies on the pretrained word and semantic embeddings, performed 
      better on most individual entity types, but NER with PWE and CE had the highest 
      classification efficiency among the proposed approaches. Extracting relations using 
      the rule-based method achieved higher accuracy than the context-aware LSTM for most 
      relations. Interestingly, the LSTM model performed notably better in the reason-drug 
      relations, the most challenging relation type. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed end-to-end 
      system achieved encouraging results and demonstrated the feasibility of using deep 
      learning methods to extract medication information from free-text data.

TI  - Can decision support combat incompleteness and bias in routine primary care data?
PG  - 1461-1467
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab025 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Routine primary care data may be used for the derivation of clinical 
      prediction rules and risk scores. We sought to measure the impact of a decision 
      support system (DSS) on data completeness and freedom from bias. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We used the clinical documentation of 34 UK general practitioners who took 
      part in a previous study evaluating the DSS. They consulted with 12 standardized 
      patients. In addition to suggesting diagnoses, the DSS facilitates data coding. We 
      compared the documentation from consultations with the electronic health record 
      (EHR) (baseline consultations) vs consultations with the EHR-integrated DSS 
      (supported consultations). We measured the proportion of EHR data items related to 
      the physician's final diagnosis. We expected that in baseline consultations, 
      physicians would document only or predominantly observations related to their 
      diagnosis, while in supported consultations, they would also document other 
      observations as a result of exploring more diagnoses and/or ease of coding. RESULTS: 
      Supported documentation contained significantly more codes (incidence rate ratio 
      [IRR] = 5.76 [4.31, 7.70] P < .001) and less free text (IRR = 0.32 [0.27, 0.40] 
      P < .001) than baseline documentation. As expected, the proportion of 
      diagnosis-related data was significantly lower (b = -0.08 [-0.11, -0.05] P < .001) 
      in the supported consultations, and this was the case for both codes and free text. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that data entry in the EHR is incomplete and 
      reflects physicians' cognitive biases. This has serious implications for 
      epidemiological research that uses routine data. A DSS that facilitates and 
      motivates data entry during the consultation can improve routine documentation.

TI  - Using text mining techniques to extract phenotypic information from the PhenoCHF 
      corpus.
PG  - S3
LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-15-S2-S3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phenotypic information locked away in unstructured narrative text 
      presents significant barriers to information accessibility, both for clinical 
      practitioners and for computerised applications used for clinical research purposes. 
      Text mining (TM) techniques have previously been applied successfully to extract 
      different types of information from text in the biomedical domain. They have the 
      potential to be extended to allow the extraction of information relating to 
      phenotypes from free text. METHODS: To stimulate the development of TM systems that 
      are able to extract phenotypic information from text, we have created a new corpus 
      (PhenoCHF) that is annotated by domain experts with several types of phenotypic 
      information relating to congestive heart failure. To ensure that systems developed 
      using the corpus are robust to multiple text types, it integrates text from 
      heterogeneous sources, i.e., electronic health records (EHRs) and scientific 
      articles from the literature. We have developed several different phenotype 
      extraction methods to demonstrate the utility of the corpus, and tested these 
      methods on a further corpus, i.e., ShARe/CLEF 2013. RESULTS: Evaluation of our 
      automated methods showed that PhenoCHF can facilitate the training of reliable 
      phenotype extraction systems, which are robust to variations in text type. These 
      results have been reinforced by evaluating our trained systems on the ShARe/CLEF 
      corpus, which contains clinical records of various types. Like other studies within 
      the biomedical domain, we found that solutions based on conditional random fields 
      produced the best results, when coupled with a rich feature set. CONCLUSIONS: 
      PhenoCHF is the first annotated corpus aimed at encoding detailed phenotypic 
      information. The unique heterogeneous composition of the corpus has been shown to be 
      advantageous in the training of systems that can accurately extract phenotypic 
      information from a range of different text types. Although the scope of our 
      annotation is currently limited to a single disease, the promising results achieved 
      can stimulate further work into the extraction of phenotypic information for other 
      diseases. The PhenoCHF annotation guidelines and annotations are publicly available 
      at https://code.google.com/p/phenochf-corpus.

      comprehensive EHR system (Epic), during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 
      the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 516 patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of diagnoses already included in the structured problem 
      list. RESULTS: Prior to review, these patients had a combined total of 2841 
      diagnoses recorded in their EHR problem lists. 1722 additional diagnoses were 
      identified, increasing the mean number of recorded problems per patient from 5.51 to 
      8.84. The overall percentage of diagnoses originally included in the problem list 
      was 62.3% (2841 / 4563, 95% confidence interval 60.8%, 63.7%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Diagnoses and other clinical information stored in a structured way in electronic 
      health records is extremely useful for supporting clinical decisions, improving 
      patient care and enabling better research. However, recording of medical diagnoses 
      on the structured problem list for inpatients is incomplete, with almost 40% of 
      important diagnoses mentioned only in the free text notes.

AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of implementing an electronic health 
      record system on staff at a Scottish hospice. BACKGROUND: Electronic health records 
      are broadly considered preferable to paper-based systems. However, changing from one 
      system to the other is difficult. This study analysed the impact of this change in a 
      Scottish hospice. DESIGN: Naturalistic prospective repeated-measures mixed-methods 
      approach. METHODS: Data on the usability of the system, staff engagement and staff 
      experience were obtained at four time points spanning 30 months from inception. 
      Quantitative data were obtained from surveys, and qualitative from concurrent 
      analysis of free-text comments and focus group. Participants were all 150 employees 
      of a single hospice in Scotland. RESULTS: Both system usability and staff engagement 
      scores decreased for the first two years before recovering at 30 months. Staff 
      experience data pointed to two main challenges: (1) Technical issues, with subthemes 
      of accessibility and usability. (2) Cultural issues, with subthemes of time, 
      teamwork, care provision and perception of change. CONCLUSIONS: It took 30 months 
      for system usability and staff engagement scores to rise, after falling 
      significantly for the first two years. The unintended outcomes of implementation 
      included challenges to the way the patient story was both recorded and communicated. 
      Nevertheless, this process of change was found to be consistent with the 'J-curve' 
      theory of organisational change, and as such, it is both predictable and manageable 
      for other organisations. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is known that 
      implementing an electronic health record system is complex. This paper puts 
      parameters on this complexity by defining both the nature of the complexity ('J' 
      curve) and the time taken for the organisation to begin recovery from the challenges 
      (two years). Understanding these parameters will help health organisations across 
      the world plan more strategically.

LID - e031191
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the validity of an algorithm to classify diagnoses 
      according to the appropriateness of outpatient antibiotic use in the context of 
      Chinese free text. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 10 000 outpatient 
      visits was selected between January and April 2018 from a national database for 
      monitoring rational use of drugs, which included data from 194 secondary and 
      tertiary hospitals in China. RESEARCH DESIGN: Diagnoses for outpatient visits were 
      classified as tier 1 if associated with at least one condition that 'always' 
      justified antibiotic use; as tier 2 if associated with at least one condition that 
      only 'sometimes' justified antibiotic use but no conditions that 'always' justified 
      antibiotic use; or as tier 3 if associated with only conditions that never justified 
      antibiotic use, using a tier-fashion method and regular expression (RE)-based 
      algorithm. MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and 
      negative predictive value (NPV) of the classification algorithm, using 
      classification made by chart review as the standard reference, were calculated. 
      RESULTS: The sensitivities of the algorithm for classifying tier 1, tier 2 and tier 
      3 diagnoses were 98.2% (95% CI 96.4% to 99.3%), 98.4% (95% CI 97.6% to 99.1%) and 
      100.0% (95% CI 100.0% to 100.0%), respectively. The specificities were 100.0% (95% 
      CI 100.0% to 100.0%), 100.0% (95% CI 99.9% to 100.0%) and 98.6% (95% CI 97.9% to 
      99.1%), respectively. The PPVs for classifying tier 1, tier 2 and tier 3 diagnoses 
      were 100.0% (95% CI 99.1% to 100.0%), 99.7% (95% CI 99.2% to 99.9%) and 99.7% (95% 
      CI 99.6% to 99.8%), respectively. The NPVs were 99.9% (95% CI 99.8% to 100.0%), 
      99.8% (95% CI 99.7% to 99.9%) and 100.0% (95% CI 99.8% to 100.0%), respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The RE-based classification algorithm in the context of Chinese free 
      text had sufficiently high validity for further evaluating the appropriateness of 
      outpatient antibiotic prescribing.

PG  - 93
LID - 093
AB  - Adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to assist with 
      clinical reasoning and streamline workflow; however, the data entry and review 
      capabilities of most systems are suboptimal which may lead to workarounds. As an 
      instance of a workaround, we examined nurses' use of optional free-text comments in 
      EHR flowsheets to support clinical needs for data interpretation. This mixed-method 
      study included: 1) Content analysis of comments, 2) Interviews with nurses. We 
      performed a sub-analysis of flowsheet data for 201 patients that experienced a 
      cardiac arrest and interviewed 5 acute care nurses. We found that nurses used 
      workarounds in the EHR - despite the extra effort that they required - to convey 
      clinically significant relationships and to communicate concerning events to 
      physicians. EHRs should better support entry of clinical data that "belongs 
      together" and enable messaging capabilities integrated with nurses' flowsheet 
      documentation workflow.

TI  - Electronic Intervention to Improve Structured Cancer Stage Data Capture.
PG  - e949-e956
AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer staging is critical for prognostication, treatment planning, and 
      determining clinical trial eligibility. Electronic health records (EHRs) have 
      structured staging modules, but physician use is inconsistent. Typically, stage is 
      entered as unstructured free text in clinical notes and cannot easily be used for 
      reporting. METHODS: We created an Epic Best Practice Advisory (BPA) decision support 
      tool that requires physicians to enter cancer stage in a structured module. If 
      certain conditions are met, the BPA is triggered as a hard stop, and the physician 
      cannot chart until staging is complete or a reason for not staging is selected. We 
      used Plan, Do, Study, Act methodology to inform the intervention and compared 
      preexisting staging rates to rates at 4, 8, and 12 months postintervention. RESULTS: 
      For 12 months before BPA implementation, 1,480 of 5,222 (28%) patients had cancer 
      stage structured within the Epic problem list. From 1 to 4 months after the BPA 
      2,057 of 1,788 (115%) cases were staged in Epic. In the 5- to 8-month period after 
      the BPA, 1,057 of 1,893 (56%) cases were staged, and 9 to 12 months after the BPA 
      1,082 of 1,817 (60%) were staged. CONCLUSION: Electronic decision support improves 
      the rate of structured cancer staging at our institution. The staging rates between 
      56% and 60% for the 5- to 8-month and 9- to 12-month periods likely reflect accurate 
      postintervention staging rates, whereas the initial 115% rate for 1 to 4 months is 
      inflated by providers staging cancers diagnosed before the BPA.

TI  - COVID-19 SignSym: a fast adaptation of a general clinical NLP tool to identify and 
      normalize COVID-19 signs and symptoms to OMOP common data model.
PG  - 1275-1283
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab015 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world rapidly, infecting millions of people. 
      An efficient tool that can accurately recognize important clinical concepts of 
      COVID-19 from free text in electronic health records (EHRs) will be valuable to 
      accelerate COVID-19 clinical research. To this end, this study aims at adapting the 
      existing CLAMP natural language processing tool to quickly build COVID-19 SignSym, 
      which can extract COVID-19 signs/symptoms and their 8 attributes (body location, 
      severity, temporal expression, subject, condition, uncertainty, negation, and 
      course) from clinical text. The extracted information is also mapped to standard 
      concepts in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model. A 
      hybrid approach of combining deep learning-based models, curated lexicons, and 
      pattern-based rules was applied to quickly build the COVID-19 SignSym from CLAMP, 
      with optimized performance. Our extensive evaluation using 3 external sites with 
      clinical notes of COVID-19 patients, as well as the online medical dialogues of 
      COVID-19, shows COVID-19 SignSym can achieve high performance across data sources. 
      The workflow used for this study can be generalized to other use cases, where 
      existing clinical natural language processing tools need to be customized for 
      specific information needs within a short time. COVID-19 SignSym is freely 
      accessible to the research community as a downloadable package 
      (https://clamp.uth.edu/covid/nlp.php) and has been used by 16 healthcare 
      organizations to support clinical research of COVID-19.

TI  - Hypoglycaemia seriousness and weight gain as determinants of cardiovascular disease 
      outcomes among sulfonylurea users.
PG  - 1425-1435
LID - 10.1111/dom.13000 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Certain treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus cause hypoglycaemia and weight 
      gain, and thus might counteract the benefits of intensive glucose control. We 
      quantify the association of cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes with hypoglycaemia 
      and weight gain among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sulfonylureas. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cohort study included patients from January 2009 through 
      December 2014 who were selected from within a deidentified nationwide electronic 
      health records repository, including multiple provider networks and electronic 
      medical records systems. Hypoglycaemia measures from structured data fields and free 
      text clinical notes were categorized as serious or non-serious. Covariate adjusted 
      Poisson regression analysis was used to assess the association between frequency of 
      hypoglycaemia (by severity), or magnitude of weight change, and incidence of acute 
      myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF) and stroke. RESULTS: 
      Among 143 635 eligible patients, we observed 5669 cases of AMI, 14 109 incident 
      cases of CHF and 7017 cases of stroke. Overall incidence rates were 1.53, 4.26 and 
      1.92 per 100 person-years for AMI, CHF and stroke, respectively. The associations 
      between overall hypoglycaemia and each of the CVD outcomes were positive, with 
      stronger associations observed for serious hypoglycaemia and attenuated or null 
      associations observed for non-serious hypoglycaemia. Weight change exhibited a 
      U-shaped association with increased risks associated with both weight loss and 
      weight gain relative to stable weight. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of 
      increased CVD risk associated with hypoglycaemia, especially with serious 
      hypoglycaemia events. While associations were attenuated with non-serious 
      hypoglycaemia, the results were suggestive of a potential increased risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary use of data collected in Electronic Health Records opens 
      perspectives for increasing our knowledge of rare diseases. The clinical data 
      warehouse (named Dr. Warehouse) at the Necker-Enfants Malades Children's Hospital 
      contains data collected during normal care for thousands of patients. Dr. Warehouse 
      is oriented toward the exploration of clinical narratives. In this study, we present 
      our method to find phenotypes associated with diseases of interest. METHODS: We 
      leveraged the frequency and TF-IDF to explore the association between clinical 
      phenotypes and rare diseases. We applied our method in six use cases: phenotypes 
      associated with the Rett, Lowe, Silver Russell, Bardet-Biedl syndromes, DOCK8 
      deficiency and Activated PI3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS). We asked domain experts 
      to evaluate the relevance of the top-50 (for frequency and TF-IDF) phenotypes 
      identified by Dr. Warehouse and computed the average precision and mean average 
      precision. RESULTS: Experts concluded that between 16 and 39 phenotypes could be 
      considered as relevant in the top-50 phenotypes ranked by descending frequency 
      discovered by Dr. Warehouse (resp. between 11 and 41 for TF-IDF). Average precision 
      ranges from 0.55 to 0.91 for frequency and 0.52 to 0.95 for TF-IDF. Mean average 
      precision was 0.79. Our study suggests that phenotypes identified in clinical 
      narratives stored in Electronic Health Record can provide rare disease specialists 
      with candidate phenotypes that can be used in addition to the literature. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Clinical Data Warehouses can be used to perform Next Generation 
      Phenotyping, especially in the context of rare diseases. We have developed a method 
      to detect phenotypes associated with a group of patients using medical concepts 
      extracted from free-text clinical narratives.

TI  - Use of a support vector machine for categorizing free-text notes: assessment of 
      accuracy across two institutions.
PG  - 887-90
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001576 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health record (EHR) users must regularly review large amounts 
      of data in order to make informed clinical decisions, and such review is 
      time-consuming and often overwhelming. Technologies like automated summarization 
      tools, EHR search engines and natural language processing have been shown to help 
      clinicians manage this information. OBJECTIVE: To develop a support vector machine 
      (SVM)-based system for identifying EHR progress notes pertaining to diabetes, and to 
      validate it at two institutions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved 2000 EHR 
      progress notes from patients with diabetes at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (1000 
      for training and 1000 for testing) and another 1000 notes from the University of 
      Texas Physicians (for validation). We manually annotated all notes and trained a SVM 
      using a bag of words approach. We then used the SVM on the testing and validation 
      sets and evaluated its performance with the area under the curve (AUC) and F 
      statistics. RESULTS: The model accurately identified diabetes-related notes in both 
      the Brigham and Women's Hospital testing set (AUC=0.956, F=0.934) and the external 
      University of Texas Faculty Physicians validation set (AUC=0.947, F=0.935). 
      DISCUSSION: Overall, the model we developed was quite accurate. Furthermore, it 
      generalized, without loss of accuracy, to another institution with a different EHR 
      and a distinct patient and provider population. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to use a 
      SVM-based classifier to identify EHR progress notes pertaining to diabetes, and the 
      model generalizes well.

      Care.
PG  - 1582-1590
LID - 10.1177/0890117118761886 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To test the association between repeated clinical smoking cessation support 
      and long-term cessation. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational cohort study using 
      structured and free-text data from electronic health records. SETTING: Six diverse 
      health systems in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥18 years who were 
      smokers in 2007 and had ≥1 primary care visit in each of the following 4 years (N = 
      33 691). MEASURES: Primary exposure was a composite categorical variable (comprised 
      of documentation of smoking cessation medication, counseling, or referral) 
      classifying the proportions of visits for which patients received any cessation 
      assistance (<25% (reference), 25%-49%, 50%-74%, and ≥75% of visits). The dependent 
      variable was long-term quit (LTQ; yes/no), defined as no indication of being a 
      current smoker for ≥365 days following a visit where nonsmoker or former smoker was 
      indicated. ANALYSIS: Mixed effects logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, 
      sex, race, and comorbidities, with robust standard error estimation to account for 
      within site correlation. RESULTS: Overall, 20% of the cohort achieved LTQ status. 
      Patients with ≥75% of visits with any assistance had almost 3 times the odds of 
      achieving LTQ status compared to those with <25% visits with assistance (odds ratio 
      = 2.84; 95% confidence interval: 1.50-5.37). Results were similar for specific 
      assistance types. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide support for the importance of 
      repeated assistance at primary care visits to increase long-term smoking cessation.

TI  - Case-finding for common mental disorders in primary care using routinely collected 
      data: a systematic review.
PG  - 1161-1175
LID - 10.1007/s00127-019-01744-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Case-finding for common mental disorders (CMD) in routine data 
      unobtrusively identifies patients for mental health research. There is absence of a 
      review of studies examining CMD-case-finding accuracy in routine primary care data. 
      CMD-case definitions include diagnostic/prescription codes, signs/symptoms, and free 
      text within electronic health records. This systematic review assesses evidence for 
      case-finding accuracy of CMD-case definitions compared to reference standards. 
      METHODS: PRISMA-DTA checklist guided review. Eligibility criteria were outlined 
      prior to study search; studies compared CMD-case definitions in routine primary care 
      data to diagnostic interviews, screening instruments, or clinician judgement. 
      Studies were quality assessed using QUADAS-2. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were 
      included, and most were at high risk of bias. Nine studies examined depressive 
      disorders and seven utilised diagnostic interviews as reference standards. Receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) planes illustrated overall variable case-finding 
      accuracy across case definitions, quantified by Youden's index. Forest plots 
      demonstrated most case definitions provide high specificity. CONCLUSION: Case 
      definitions effectively identify cases in a population with good accuracy and few 
      false positives. For 100 anxiety cases, identified using diagnostic codes, between 
      12 and 20 will be false positives; 0-47 cases will be missed. Sensitivity is more 
      variable and specificity is higher in depressive cases; for 100 cases identified 
      using diagnostic codes, between 0 and 87 will be false positives; 4-18 cases will be 
      missed. Incorporating context to case definitions may improve overall case-finding 
      accuracy. Further research is required for meta-analysis and robust conclusions.

TI  - Assessing the Representation of Occupation Information in Free-Text Clinical 
      Documents Across Multiple Sources.
PG  - 486-490
AB  - There has been increasing recognition of the key role of social determinants like 
      occupation on health. Given the relatively poor understanding of occupation 
      information in electronic health records (EHRs), we sought to characterize 
      occupation information within free-text clinical document sources. From six distinct 
      clinical sources, 868 total occupation-related sentences were identified for the 
      study corpus. Building off approaches from previous studies, refined annotation 
      guidelines were created using the National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
      Health Occupational Data for Health data model with elements added to increase 
      granularity. Our corpus generated 2,005 total annotations representing 39 of 41 
      entity types from the enhanced data model. Highest frequency entities were: 
      Occupation Description (17.7%); Employment Status - Not Specified (12.5%); Employer 
      Name (11.0%); Subject (9.8%); Industry Description (6.2%). Our findings support the 
      value of standardizing entry of EHR occupation information to improve data quality 
      for improved patient care and secondary uses of this information.

TI  - Efficient identification of patients eligible for clinical studies using case-based 
      reasoning on Scottish Health Research register (SHARE).
PG  - 70

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trials often struggle to achieve their target sample size with only half 
      doing so. Some researchers have turned to Electronic Health Records (EHRs), seeking 
      a more efficient way of recruitment. The Scottish Health Research Register (SHARE) 
      obtained patients' consent for their EHRs to be used as a searching base from which 
      researchers can find potential participants. However, due to the fact that EHR data 
      is not complete, sufficient or accurate, a database search strategy may not generate 
      the best case-finding result. The current study aims to evaluate the performance of 
      a case-based reasoning method in identifying participants for population-based 
      clinical studies recruiting through SHARE, and assess the difference between its 
      resultant cohort and the original one deriving from searching EHRs. METHODS: A 
      case-based reasoning framework was applied to 119 participants in nine projects 
      using two-fold cross-validation, with records from a further 86,292 individuals used 
      for testing. A prediction score for study participation was derived from the 
      diagnosis, procedure, pharmaceutical prescription, and laboratory test results 
      attributes of each participant. Evaluation was conducted by calculating Area Under 
      the ROC Curve and information retrieval metrics for the ranking list of the test set 
      by prediction score. We compared the most likely participants as identified by 
      searching a database to those ranked highest by our model. RESULTS: The average 
      ROCAUC for nine projects was 81% indicating strong predictive ability for these 
      data. However, the derived ranking lists showed lower predictive performance, with 
      only 21% of the persons ranked within top 50 positions being the same as identified 
      by searching databases. CONCLUSIONS: Case-based reasoning is may be more effective 
      than a database search strategy for participant identification for clinical studies 
      using population EHRs. The lower performance of ranking lists derived from 
      case-based reasoning means that patients identified as highly suitable for study 
      participation may still not be recruited. This suggests that further study is needed 
      into improvements in the collection and curation of population EHRs, such as use of 
      free text data to aid reliable identification of people more likely to be recruited 
      to clinical trials.

TI  - Identification of asthma control factor in clinical notes using a hybrid deep 
      learning model.
PG  - 272

LID - 272
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are significant variabilities in guideline-concordant 
      documentation in asthma care. However, assessing clinician's documentation is not 
      feasible using only structured data but requires labor-intensive chart review of 
      electronic health records (EHRs). A certain guideline element in asthma control 
      factors, such as review inhaler techniques, requires context understanding to 
      correctly capture from EHR free text. METHODS: The study data consist of two sets: 
      (1) manual chart reviewed data-1039 clinical notes of 300 patients with asthma 
      diagnosis, and (2) weakly labeled data (distant supervision)-27,363 clinical notes 
      from 800 patients with asthma diagnosis. A context-aware language model, 
      Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) was developed to 
      identify inhaler techniques in EHR free text. Both original BERT and clinical 
      BioBERT (cBERT) were applied with a cost-sensitivity to deal with imbalanced data. 
      The distant supervision using weak labels by rules was also incorporated to augment 
      the training set and alleviate a costly manual labeling process in the development 
      of a deep learning algorithm. A hybrid approach using post-hoc rules was also 
      explored to fix BERT model errors. The performance of BERT with/without distant 
      supervision, hybrid, and rule-based models were compared in precision, recall, 
      F-score, and accuracy. RESULTS: The BERT models on the original data performed 
      similar to a rule-based model in F1-score (0.837, 0.845, and 0.838 for rules, BERT, 
      and cBERT, respectively). The BERT models with distant supervision produced higher 
      performance (0.853 and 0.880 for BERT and cBERT, respectively) than without distant 
      supervision and a rule-based model. The hybrid models performed best in F1-score of 
      0.877 and 0.904 over the distant supervision on BERT and cBERT. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      proposed BERT models with distant supervision demonstrated its capability to 
      identify inhaler techniques in EHR free text, and outperformed both the rule-based 
      model and BERT models trained on the original data. With a distant supervision 
      approach, we may alleviate costly manual chart review to generate the large training 
      data required in most deep learning-based models. A hybrid model was able to fix 
      BERT model errors and further improve the performance.

LID - e380
AB  - BACKGROUND: Automated disease code classification using free-text medical 
      information is important for public health surveillance. However, traditional 
      natural language processing (NLP) pipelines are limited, so we propose a method 
      combining word embedding with a convolutional neural network (CNN). OBJECTIVE: Our 
      objective was to compare the performance of traditional pipelines (NLP plus 
      supervised machine learning models) with that of word embedding combined with a CNN 
      in conducting a classification task identifying International Classification of 
      Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes in 
      discharge notes. METHODS: We used 2 classification methods: (1) extracting from 
      discharge notes some features (terms, n-gram phrases, and SNOMED CT categories) that 
      we used to train a set of supervised machine learning models (support vector 
      machine, random forests, and gradient boosting machine), and (2) building a feature 
      matrix, by a pretrained word embedding model, that we used to train a CNN. We used 
      these methods to identify the chapter-level ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes in a set of 
      discharge notes. We conducted the evaluation using 103,390 discharge notes covering 
      patients hospitalized from June 1, 2015 to January 31, 2017 in the Tri-Service 
      General Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. We used the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve as an evaluation measure, and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) and 
      F-measure as the global measure of effectiveness. RESULTS: In 5-fold 
      cross-validation tests, our method had a higher testing accuracy (mean AUC 0.9696; 
      mean F-measure 0.9086) than traditional NLP-based approaches (mean AUC range 
      0.8183-0.9571; mean F-measure range 0.5050-0.8739). A real-world simulation that 
      split the training sample and the testing sample by date verified this result (mean 
      AUC 0.9645; mean F-measure 0.9003 using the proposed method). Further analysis 
      showed that the convolutional layers of the CNN effectively identified a large 
      number of keywords and automatically extracted enough concepts to predict the 
      diagnosis codes. CONCLUSIONS: Word embedding combined with a CNN showed outstanding 
      performance compared with traditional methods, needing very little data 
      preprocessing. This shows that future studies will not be limited by incomplete 
      dictionaries. A large amount of unstructured information from free-text medical 
      writing will be extracted by automated approaches in the future, and we believe that 
      the health care field is about to enter the age of big data.

TI  - An Assessment of Family History Information Captured in an Electronic Health Record.
PG  - 2035-42
AB  - Family history is considered a core element of clinical care. In this study we 
      assessed the quality of family history data captured in an established commercial 
      electronic health record (EHR) at a large academic medical center. Because the EHR 
      had no centralized location to store family history information, it was collected as 
      part of clinical notes in structured or free-text format. We analyzed differences 
      between 10,000 free-text and 9,121 structured family history observations. Each 
      observation was classified according to disease presence/absence and family member 
      affected (e.g., father, mother, etc.). The structured notes did not collect a 
      complete family history as defined by standards endorsed by the U.S. Agency for 
      Healthcare Research and Quality; the free-text notes contained more information than 
      the structured notes, but still not enough to be considered "complete." Several 
      barriers remain for collecting complete, useful family history data in electronic 
      health records.

TI  - Evaluating the Impact of Text Duplications on a Corpus of More than 600,000 Clinical 
      Narratives in a French Hospital.
PG  - 103-107
LID - 10.3233/SHTI190192 [doi]
AB  - A significant part of medical knowledge is stored as unstructured free text. 
      However, clinical narratives are known to contain duplicated sections due to 
      clinicians' copy/paste parts of a former report into a new one. In this study, we 
      aim at evaluating the duplications found within patient records in more than 650,000 
      French clinical narratives. We adapted a method to identify efficiently duplicated 
      zones in a reasonable time. We evaluated the potential impact of duplications in two 
      use cases: the presence of (i) treatments and/or (ii) relative dates. We identified 
      an average rate of duplication of 33%. We found that 20% of the document contained 
      drugs mentioned only in duplicated zones and that 1.45% of the document contained 
      mentions of relative dates in duplicated zone, that could potentially lead to 
      erroneous interpretation. We suggest the systematic identification and annotation of 
      duplicated zones in clinical narratives for information extraction and 
      temporal-oriented tasks.

TI  - Optimising use of electronic health records to describe the presentation of 
      rheumatoid arthritis in primary care: a strategy for developing code lists.
PG  - e54878
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0054878 [doi]
LID - e54878
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research using electronic health records (EHRs) relies heavily on coded 
      clinical data. Due to variation in coding practices, it can be difficult to 
      aggregate the codes for a condition in order to define cases. This paper describes a 
      methodology to develop 'indicator markers' found in patients with early rheumatoid 
      arthritis (RA); these are a broader range of codes which may allow a probabilistic 
      case definition to use in cases where no diagnostic code is yet recorded. METHODS: 
      We examined EHRs of 5,843 patients in the General Practice Research Database, aged ≥ 
      30 y, with a first coded diagnosis of RA between 2005 and 2008. Lists of indicator 
      markers for RA were developed initially by panels of clinicians drawing up 
      code-lists and then modified based on scrutiny of available data. The prevalence of 
      indicator markers, and their temporal relationship to RA codes, was examined in 
      patients from 3 y before to 14 d after recorded RA diagnosis. FINDINGS: Indicator 
      markers were common throughout EHRs of RA patients, with 83.5% having 2 or more 
      markers. 34% of patients received a disease-specific prescription before RA was 
      coded; 42% had a referral to rheumatology, and 63% had a test for rheumatoid factor. 
      65% had at least one joint symptom or sign recorded and in 44% this was at least 
      6-months before recorded RA diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Indicator markers of RA may be 
      valuable for case definition in cases which do not yet have a diagnostic code. The 
      clinical diagnosis of RA is likely to occur some months before it is coded, shown by 
      markers frequently occurring ≥ 6 months before recorded diagnosis. It is difficult 
      to differentiate delay in diagnosis from delay in recording. Information concealed 
      in free text may be required for the accurate identification of patients and to 
      assess the quality of care in general practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numbers and numerical concepts appear frequently in free text clinical 
      notes from electronic health records. Knowledge of the frequent lexical variations 
      of these numerical concepts, and their accurate identification, is important for 
      many information extraction tasks. This paper describes an analysis of the variation 
      in how numbers and numerical concepts are represented in clinical notes. METHODS: We 
      used an inverted index of approximately 100 million notes to obtain the frequency of 
      various permutations of numbers and numerical concepts, including the use of Roman 
      numerals, numbers spelled as English words, and invalid dates, among others. 
      Overall, twelve types of lexical variants were analyzed. RESULTS: We found 
      substantial variation in how these concepts were represented in the notes, including 
      multiple data quality issues. We also demonstrate that not considering these 
      variations could have substantial real-world implications for cohort identification 
      tasks, with one case missing > 80% of potential patients. CONCLUSIONS: Numbering 
      within clinical notes can be variable, and not taking these variations into account 
      could result in missing or inaccurate information for natural language processing 
      and information retrieval tasks.

TI  - Fidelity of Electronic Documentation for Reactions Prompting Premedication to 
      Iodinated Contrast Media.

LID - S1546-1440(21)00023-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jacr.2021.01.005 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to assess the fidelity of electronic health 
      record documentation prompting premedication to iodinated contrast media and to 
      determine the appropriateness of administered premedication on the basis of that 
      documentation. METHODS: In this retrospective quality assurance cohort study, 
      medication adverse events recorded in electronic health records between January 1, 
      2018, and August 31, 2019, to "iodine," "iodine-containing products," and "iodinated 
      contrast media" were identified (N = 4,309); entries missing documentation (n = 
      1,651) and breakthrough reactions (n = 22) were excluded. Reaction description, 
      severity, and free-text comments were used to categorize each entry as concordant 
      (documentation matches recorded severity per the ACR Manual on Contrast Media 
      version 10.3), discordant (description-severity mismatch, agent unrelated to 
      iodinated contrast media, not a hypersensitivity reaction), or unclear. A subset of 
      patients undergoing premedication was identified, and premedication was categorized 
      as appropriate, inappropriate, or unsure on the basis of the index reaction using 
      the aforementioned framework. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: There 
      were 2,636 adverse event entries in 2,441 patients: 59.9% (1,578 of 2,636) were 
      classified as concordant, 30.2% (797 of 2,636) as discordant (n = 377 not a 
      hypersensitivity reaction, n = 317 description-severity mismatch, and n = 103 
      unrelated agent), and 9.9% (n = 261) as unclear documentation. For the premedicated 
      subset, concordance classification was feasible for 202 unique patients premedicated 
      335 times. Premedication was appropriate in 72% (240 of 335) and inappropriate in 
      22% (73 of 335); 17% of premedication events (56 of 335) were inappropriately 
      administered for a prior physiologic reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Premedication prompts in 
      the electronic health record are often erroneous because of inaccurate coding, 
      incomplete data, and reaction misclassification. These errors result in 
      inappropriate premedication for a substantial minority of patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are difficult to diagnose early and have 
      risk factors that are easy to overlook. Early prediction and personalization of 
      treatment through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) may help clinicians and 
      patients manage CVDs more effectively. However, to apply AI approaches to CVDs data, 
      it is necessary to establish and curate a specialized database based on electronic 
      health records (EHRs) and include pre-processed unstructured data. METHODS: To build 
      a suitable database (CardioNet) for CVDs that can utilize AI technology, 
      contributing to the overall care of patients with CVDs. First, we collected the 
      anonymized records of 748,474 patients who had visited the Asan Medical Center (AMC) 
      or Ulsan University Hospital (UUH) because of CVDs. Second, we set clinically 
      plausible criteria to remove errors and duplication. Third, we integrated 
      unstructured data such as readings of medical examinations with structured data 
      sourced from EHRs to create the CardioNet. We subsequently performed natural 
      language processing to structuralize the significant variables associated with CVDs 
      because most results of the principal CVD-related medical examinations are free-text 
      readings. Additionally, to ensure interoperability for convergent multi-center 
      research, we standardized the data using several codes that correspond to the common 
      data model. Finally, we created the descriptive table (i.e., dictionary of the 
      CardioNet) to simplify access and utilization of data for clinicians and engineers 
      and continuously validated the data to ensure reliability. RESULTS: CardioNet is a 
      comprehensive database that can serve as a training set for AI models and assist in 
      all aspects of clinical management of CVDs. It comprises information extracted from 
      EHRs and results of readings of CVD-related digital tests. It consists of 27 tables, 
      a code-master table, and a descriptive table. CONCLUSIONS: CardioNet database 
      specialized in CVDs was established, with continuing data collection. We are 
      actively supporting multi-center research, which may require further data 
      processing, depending on the subject of the study. CardioNet will serve as the 
      fundamental database for future CVD-related research projects.

TI  - Development of Predictive Informatics Tool Using Electronic Health Records to Inform 
      Personalized Evidence-Based Pressure Injury Management for Veterans with Spinal Cord 
      Injury.
PG  - 651-658
LID - 10.1093/milmed/usaa469 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure injuries (PrI) are serious complications for many with spinal 
      cord injury (SCI), significantly burdening health care systems, in particular the 
      Veterans Health Administration. Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) provide 
      recommendations. However, many risk factors span multiple domains. Effective 
      prioritization of CPG recommendations has been identified as a need. Bioinformatics 
      facilitates clinical decision support for complex challenges. The Veteran's 
      Administration Informatics and Computing Infrastructure provides access to 
      electronic health record (EHR) data for all Veterans Health Administration health 
      care encounters. The overall study objective was to expand our prototype structural 
      model of environmental, social, and clinical factors and develop the foundation for 
      resource which will provide weighted systemic insight into PrI risk in veterans with 
      SCI. METHODS: The SCI PrI Resource (SCI-PIR) includes three integrated modules: (1) 
      the SCIPUDSphere multidomain database of veterans' EHR data extracted from October 
      2010 to September 2015 for ICD-9-CM coding consistency together with tissue health 
      profiles, (2) the Spinal Cord Injury Pressure Ulcer and Deep Tissue Injury Ontology 
      (SCIPUDO) developed from the cohort's free text clinical note (Text Integration 
      Utility) notes, and (3) the clinical user interface for direct SCI-PIR query. 
      RESULTS: The SCI-PIR contains relevant EHR data for a study cohort of 36,626 
      veterans with SCI, representing 10% to 14% of the U.S. population with SCI. 
      Extracted datasets include SCI diagnostics, demographics, comorbidities, rurality, 
      medications, and laboratory tests. Many terminology variations for non-coded input 
      data were found. SCIPUDO facilitates robust information extraction from over six 
      million Text Integration Utility notes annually for the study cohort. Visual widgets 
      in the clinical user interface can be directly populated with SCIPUDO terms, 
      allowing patient-specific query construction. CONCLUSION: The SCI-PIR contains 
      valuable clinical data based on CPG-identified risk factors, providing a basis for 
      personalized PrI risk management following SCI. Understanding the relative impact of 
      risk factors supports PrI management for veterans with SCI. Personalized interactive 
      programs can enhance best practices by decreasing both initial PrI formation and 
      readmission rates due to PrI recurrence for veterans with SCI.

TI  - Predicting colorectal surgical complications using heterogeneous clinical data and

LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2016.03.008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this work, we have developed a learning system capable of exploiting 
      information conveyed by longitudinal Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for the 
      prediction of a common postoperative complication, Anastomosis Leakage (AL), in a 
      data-driven way and by fusing temporal population data from different and 
      heterogeneous sources in the EHRs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used linear and 
      non-linear kernel methods individually for each data source, and leveraging the 
      powerful multiple kernels for their effective combination. To validate the system, 
      we used data from the EHR of the gastrointestinal department at a university 
      hospital. RESULTS: We first investigated the early prediction performance from each 
      data source separately, by computing Area Under the Curve values for processed free 
      text (0.83), blood tests (0.74), and vital signs (0.65), respectively. When 
      exploiting the heterogeneous data sources combined using the composite kernel 
      framework, the prediction capabilities increased considerably (0.92). Finally, 
      posterior probabilities were evaluated for risk assessment of patients as an aid for 
      clinicians to raise alertness at an early stage, in order to act promptly for 
      avoiding AL complications. DISCUSSION: Machine-learning statistical model from EHR 
      data can be useful to predict surgical complications. The combination of EHR 
      extracted free text, blood samples values, and patient vital signs, improves the 
      model performance. These results can be used as a framework for preoperative 
      clinical decision support.

TI  - Unbiased identification of patients with disorders of sex development.
PG  - e108702

LID - e108702
AB  - Disorders of sex development (DSD) represent a collection of rare diseases that 
      generate substantial controversy regarding best practices for diagnosis and 
      treatment. A significant barrier preventing a better understanding of how patients 
      with these conditions should be evaluated and treated, especially from a 
      psychological standpoint, is the lack of systematic and standardized approaches to 
      identify cases for study inclusion. Common approaches include "hand-picked" subjects 
      already known to the practice, which could introduce bias. We implemented an 
      informatics-based approach to identify patients with DSD from electronic health 
      records (EHRs) at three large, academic children's hospitals. The informatics 
      approach involved comprehensively searching EHRs at each hospital using a 
      combination of structured billing codes as an initial filtering strategy followed by 
      keywords applied to the free text clinical documentation. The informatics approach 
      was implemented to replicate the functionality of an EHR search engine (EMERSE) 
      available at one of the hospitals. At the two hospitals that did not have EMERSE, we 
      compared case ascertainment using the informatics method to traditional approaches 
      employed for identifying subjects. Potential cases identified using all approaches 
      were manually reviewed by experts in DSD to verify eligibility criteria. At the two 
      institutions where both the informatics and traditional approaches were applied, the 
      informatics approach identified substantially higher numbers of potential study 
      subjects. The traditional approaches yielded 14 and 28 patients with DSD, 
      respectively; the informatics approach yielded 226 and 77 patients, respectively. 
      The informatics approach missed only a few cases that the traditional approaches 
      identified, largely because those cases were known to the study team, but patient 
      data were not in the particular children's hospital EHR. The use of informatics 
      approaches to search electronic documentation can result in substantially larger 
      numbers of subjects identified for studies of rare diseases such as DSD, and these 
      approaches can be applied across hospitals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality improvement requires using quality measures that can be 
      implemented in a valid manner. Using guidelines set forth by the Meaningful Use 
      portion of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, 
      the authors assessed the feasibility and performance of an automated electronic 
      Meaningful Use dental clinical quality measure to determine the percentage of 
      children who received fluoride varnish. METHODS: The authors defined how to 
      implement the automated measure queries in a dental electronic health record. Within 
      records identified through automated query, the authors manually reviewed a 
      subsample to assess the performance of the query. RESULTS: The automated query 
      results revealed that 71.0% of patients had fluoride varnish compared with the 
      manual chart review results that indicated 77.6% of patients had fluoride varnish. 
      The automated quality measure performance results indicated 90.5% sensitivity, 90.8% 
      specificity, 96.9% positive predictive value, and 75.2% negative predictive value. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings support the feasibility of using automated dental 
      quality measure queries in the context of sufficient structured data. Information 
      noted only in free text rather than in structured data would require using natural 
      language processing approaches to effectively query electronic health records. 
      PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: To participate in self-directed quality improvement, dental 
      clinicians must embrace the accountability era. Commitment to quality will require 
      enhanced documentation to support near-term automated calculation of quality 
      measures.

TI  - The accuracy of fully automated algorithms for surveillance of healthcare-associated 
      urinary tract infections in hospitalized patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveillance for healthcare-associated infections such as 
      healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (HA-UTI) is important for directing 
      resources and evaluating interventions. However, traditional surveillance methods 
      are resource-intensive and subject to bias. AIM: To develop and validate a fully 
      automated surveillance algorithm for HA-UTI using electronic health record (EHR) 
      data. METHODS: Five algorithms were developed using EHR data from 2979 admissions at 
      Karolinska University Hospital from 2010 to 2011: (1) positive urine culture (UCx); 
      (2) positive UCx + UTI codes (International Statistical Classification of Diseases 
      and Related Health Problems, 10(th) revision); (3) positive UCx + UTI-specific 
      antibiotics; (4) positive UCx + fever and/or UTI symptoms; (5) algorithm 4 with 
      negation for fever without UTI symptoms. Natural language processing (NLP) was used 
      for processing free-text medical notes. The algorithms were validated in 1258 
      potential UTI episodes from January to March 2012 and results extrapolated to all 
      UTI episodes within this period (N = 16,712). The reference standard for HA-UTIs was 
      manual record review according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and 
      Control (and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) definitions by trained 
      healthcare personnel. FINDINGS: Of the 1258 UTI episodes, 163 fulfilled the ECDC 
      HA-UTI definition and the algorithms classified 391, 150, 189, 194, and 153 UTI 
      episodes, respectively, as HA-UTI. Algorithms 1, 2, and 3 had insufficient 
      performances. Algorithm 4 achieved better performance and algorithm 5 performed best 
      for surveillance purposes with sensitivity 0.667 (95% confidence interval: 
      0.594-0.733), specificity 0.997 (0.996-0.998), positive predictive value 0.719 
      (0.624-0.807) and negative predictive value 0.997 (0.996-0.997). CONCLUSION: A fully 
      automated surveillance algorithm based on NLP to find UTI symptoms in free-text had 
      acceptable performance to detect HA-UTI compared to manual record review. Algorithms 
      based on administrative and microbiology data only were not sufficient.

PG  - 34-9
LID - 10.2174/1874431101307010034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vital signs in our emergency department information system were entered 
      into free-text fields for heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, temperature 
      and oxygen saturation. OBJECTIVE: We sought to convert these text entries into a 
      more useful form, for research and QA purposes, upon entry into a data warehouse. 
      METHODS: We derived a series of rules and assigned quality scores to the transformed 
      values, conforming to physiologic parameters for vital signs across the age range 
      and spectrum of illness seen in the emergency department. RESULTS: Validating these 
      entries revealed that 98% of free-text data had perfect quality scores, conforming 
      to established vital sign parameters. Average vital signs varied as expected by age. 
      Degradations in quality scores were most commonly attributed logging temperature in 
      Fahrenheit instead of Celsius; vital signs with this error could still be 
      transformed for use. Errors occurred more frequently during periods of high triage, 
      though error rates did not correlate with triage volume. CONCLUSIONS: In developing 
      a method for importing free-text vital sign data from our emergency department 
      information system, we now have a data warehouse with a broad array of 
      quality-checked vital signs, permitting analysis and correlation with demographics 
      and outcomes.

TI  - A Deep Language Model for Symptom Extraction from Clinical Text and Its Application 
      to Extract COVID-19 symptoms from Social Media.
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2021.3123192 [doi]
AB  - Patients experience various symptoms when they have either acute or chronic diseases 
      or undergo some treatments for diseases. Symptoms are often indicators of the 
      severity of the disease and the need for hospitalization. Symptoms are often 
      described in free text written as clinical notes in the Electronic Health Records 
      (EHR) and are not integrated with other clinical factors for disease prediction and 
      healthcare outcome management. In this research, we propose a novel deep language 
      model to extract patient-reported symptoms from clinical text. The deep language 
      model integrates syntactic and semantic analysis for symptom extraction and 
      identifies the actual symptoms reported by patients and conditional or negation 
      symptoms. The deep language model can extract both complex and straightforward 
      symptom expressions. We used a real-world clinical notes dataset to evaluate our 
      model and demonstrated that our model achieves superior performance compared to 
      three other state-of-the-art symptom extraction models. We extensively analyzed our 
      model to illustrate its effectiveness by examining each components contribution to 
      the model. Finally, we applied our model on a COVID-19 tweets data set to extract 
      COVID-19 symptoms. The results show that our model can identify all the symptoms 
      suggested by CDC ahead of their timeline and many rare symptoms.

PG  - 1069-75
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002733 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Depression is a prevalent disorder difficult to diagnose and treat. In 
      particular, depressed patients exhibit largely unpredictable responses to treatment. 
      Toward the goal of personalizing treatment for depression, we develop and evaluate 
      computational models that use electronic health record (EHR) data for predicting the 
      diagnosis and severity of depression, and response to treatment. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We develop regression-based models for predicting depression, its severity, 
      and response to treatment from EHR data, using structured diagnosis and medication 
      codes as well as free-text clinical reports. We used two datasets: 35,000 patients 
      (5000 depressed) from the Palo Alto Medical Foundation and 5651 patients treated for 
      depression from the Group Health Research Institute. RESULTS: Our models are able to 
      predict a future diagnosis of depression up to 12 months in advance (area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.70-0.80). We can differentiate 
      patients with severe baseline depression from those with minimal or mild baseline 
      depression (AUC 0.72). Baseline depression severity was the strongest predictor of 
      treatment response for medication and psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to 
      use EHR data to predict a diagnosis of depression up to 12 months in advance and to 
      differentiate between extreme baseline levels of depression. The models use commonly 
      available data on diagnosis, medication, and clinical progress notes, making them 
      easily portable. The ability to automatically determine severity can facilitate 
      assembly of large patient cohorts with similar severity from multiple sites, which 
      may enable elucidation of the moderators of treatment response in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical information is often stored as free text, e.g. in discharge 
      summaries or pathology reports. These documents are semi-structured using section 
      headers, numbered lists, items and classification strings. However, it is still 
      challenging to retrieve relevant documents since keyword searches applied on 
      complete unstructured documents result in many false positive retrieval results. 
      OBJECTIVES: We are concentrating on the processing of pathology reports as an 
      example for unstructured clinical documents. The objective is to transform reports 
      semi-automatically into an information structure that enables an improved access and 
      retrieval of relevant data. The data is expected to be stored in a standardized, 
      structured way to make it accessible for queries that are applied to specific 
      sections of a document (section-sensitive queries) and for information reuse. 
      METHODS: Our processing pipeline comprises information modelling, section boundary 
      detection and section-sensitive queries. For enabling a focused search in 
      unstructured data, documents are automatically structured and transformed into a 
      patient information model specified through openEHR archetypes. The resulting 
      XML-based pathology electronic health records (PEHRs) are queried by XQuery and 
      visualized by XSLT in HTML. RESULTS: Pathology reports (PRs) can be reliably 
      structured into sections by a keyword-based approach. The information modelling 
      using openEHR allows saving time in the modelling process since many archetypes can 
      be reused. The resulting standardized, structured PEHRs allow accessing relevant 
      data by retrieving data matching user queries. CONCLUSIONS: Mapping unstructured 
      reports into a standardized information model is a practical solution for a better 
      access to data. Archetype-based XML enables section-sensitive retrieval and 
      visualisation by well-established XML techniques. Focussing the retrieval to 
      particular sections has the potential of saving retrieval time and improving the 
      accuracy of the retrieval.

PG  - 624-8
AB  - Rapid growth in electronic health records (EHRs) use has led to an unprecedented 
      expansion of available clinical data in electronic formats. However, much of the 
      important healthcare information is locked in the narrative documents. Therefore 
      Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, e.g., Named Entity Recognition that 
      identifies boundaries and types of entities, has been extensively studied to unlock 
      important clinical information in free text. In this study, we investigated a novel 
      deep learning method to recognize clinical entities in Chinese clinical documents 
      using the minimal feature engineering approach. We developed a deep neural network 
      (DNN) to generate word embeddings from a large unlabeled corpus through unsupervised 
      learning and another DNN for the NER task. The experiment results showed that the 
      DNN with word embeddings trained from the large unlabeled corpus outperformed the 
      state-of-the-art CRF's model in the minimal feature engineering setting, achieving 
      the highest F1-score of 0.9280. Further analysis showed that word embeddings derived 
      through unsupervised learning from large unlabeled corpus remarkably improved the 
      DNN with randomized embedding, denoting the usefulness of unsupervised feature 
      learning.

TI  - Development of Hospital-based Data Sets as a Vehicle for Implementation of a 
      National Electronic Health Record.
PG  - 1f
LID - 1f
AB  - BACKGROUND: In developing countries such as Iran, international standards offer good 
      sources to survey and use for appropriate planning in the domain of electronic 
      health records (EHRs). Therefore, in this study, HL7 and ASTM standards were 
      considered as the main sources from which to extract EHR data. OBJECTIVE: The 
      objective of this study was to propose a hospital data set for a national EHR 
      consisting of data classes and data elements by adjusting data sets extracted from 
      the standards and paper-based records. METHOD: This comparative study was carried 
      out in 2017 by studying the contents of the paper-based records approved by the 
      health ministry in Iran and the international ASTM and HL7 standards in order to 
      extract a minimum hospital data set for a national EHR. RESULTS: As a result of 
      studying the standards and paper-based records, a total of 526 data elements in 174 
      classes were extracted. An examination of the data indicated that the highest number 
      of extracted data came from the free text elements, both in the paper-based records 
      and in the standards related to the administrative data. The major sources of data 
      extracted from ASTM and HL7 were the E1384 and Hl7V.x standards, respectively. In 
      the paper-based records, data were extracted from 19 forms sporadically. DISCUSSION: 
      By declaring the confidentiality of information, the ASTM standards acknowledge the 
      issue of confidentiality of information as one of the main challenges of EHR 
      development, and propose new types of admission, such as teleconference, tele-video, 
      and home visit, which are inevitable with the advent of new technology for providing 
      healthcare and treating diseases. Data related to finance and insurance, which were 
      scattered in different categories by three organizations, emerged as the financial 
      category. Documenting the role and responsibility of the provider by adding the 
      authenticator/signature data element was deemed essential. CONCLUSION: Not only 
      using well-defined and standardized data, but also adapting EHR systems to the local 
      facilities and the existing social and cultural conditions, will facilitate the 
      development of structured data sets.

TI  - The general practitioners perspective regarding registration of persistent somatic 
      symptoms in primary care: a survey.
PG  - 182
LID - 10.1186/s12875-021-01525-6 [doi]
LID - 182
AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent somatic symptoms (PSS) are common in primary care and often 
      accompanied by an increasing disease burden for both the patient and healthcare. In 
      medical practice, PSS is historically considered a diagnosis by exclusion or 
      primarily seen as psychological. Besides, registration of PSS in electronic health 
      records (EHR) is unambiguous and possibly does not reflect classification 
      adequately. The present study explores how general practitioners (GPs) currently 
      register PSS, and their view regarding the need for improvements in classification, 
      registration, and consultations. METHOD: Dutch GPs were invited by email to 
      participate in a national cross-sectional online survey. The survey addressed 
      ICPC-codes used by GPs to register PSS, PSS-related terminology added to free text 
      areas, usage of PSS-related syndrome codes, and GPs' need for improvement of PSS 
      classification, registration and care. RESULTS: GPs (n = 259) were most likely to 
      use codes specific to the symptom presented (89.3%). PSS-related terminology in 
      free-text areas was used sparsely. PSS-related syndrome codes were reportedly used 
      by 91.5% of GPs, but this was primarily the case for the code for irritable bowel 
      syndrome. The ambiguous registration of PSS is reported as problematic by 47.9% of 
      GPs. Over 56.7% of GPs reported needing additional training, tools or other support 
      for PSS classification and consultation. GPs also reported needing other referral 
      options and better guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Registration of PSS in primary care is 
      currently ambiguous. Approximately half of GPs felt a need for more options for 
      registration of PSS and reported a need for further support. In order to improve 
      classification, registration and care for patients with PSS, there is a need for a 
      more appropriate coding scheme and additional training.

TI  - [Contribution to quality of care or caught in a digital labyrinth? Experience with 
      electronic records of patients receiving long-term mental health care].
PG  - 394-401
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years electronic health records (EHRs) have been introduced on 
      a large scale into mental health care. EHRs have a great number of advantages, one 
      of the main ones being readability. However, very little attention seems to have 
      been paid to the potential disadvantages and risks associated with EHRs. AIM: To 
      point to some of the disadvantages and risks of EHRs, in their present form, 
      particularly in relation to the care of patients with severe mental illness (SMI). 
      METHOD: On the basis of clinical experience and relevant literature, we discuss some 
      of the disadvantages and risks associated with EHRs in their current form. RESULTS: 
      In long-term, multidisciplinary and complex treatments of patients with SMI, EHRs in 
      their current form fail to provide the psychiatrist with an adequate overview of the 
      treatment process. This is largely due to the way they are designed: an 
      ever-increasing quantity of information about complex treatment stored in separate 
      files that can only be accessed individually and that contain free text. In mental 
      health care the introduction of new technology, unlike the introduction of new 
      drugs, seems to occur without structured surveillance of the disadvantages and risks 
      involved. CONCLUSION: EHRs need to be re-designed at the earliest opportunity.

TI  - Building a Shared, Scalable, and Sustainable Source for the Problem-Oriented Medical 
      Record: Developmental Study.
PG  - e29174
LID - 10.2196/29174 [doi]
LID - e29174
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the creation of the problem-oriented medical record, the building 
      of problem lists has been the focus of many studies. To date, this issue is not well 
      resolved, and building an appropriate contextualized problem list is still a 
      challenge. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to present the process of building a shared 
      multipurpose common problem list at the Geneva University Hospitals. This list aims 
      to bridge the gap between clinicians' language expressed in free text and secondary 
      uses requiring structured information. METHODS: We focused on the needs of 
      clinicians by building a list of uniquely identified expressions to support their 
      daily activities. In the second stage, these expressions were connected to 
      additional information to build a complex graph of information. A list of 45,946 
      expressions manually extracted from clinical documents was manually curated and 
      encoded in multiple semantic dimensions, such as International Classification of 
      Diseases, 10th revision; International Classification of Primary Care 2nd edition; 
      Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms; or dimensions dictated by 
      specific usages, such as identifying expressions specific to a domain, a gender, or 
      an intervention. The list was progressively deployed for clinicians with an 
      iterative process of quality control, maintenance, and improvements, including the 
      addition of new expressions or dimensions for specific needs. The problem management 
      of the electronic health record allowed the measurement and correction of encoding 
      based on real-world use. RESULTS: The list was deployed in production in January 
      2017 and was regularly updated and deployed in new divisions of the hospital. Over 4 
      years, 684,102 problems were created using the list. The proportion of free-text 
      entries decreased progressively from 37.47% (8321/22,206) in December 2017 to 18.38% 
      (4547/24,738) in December 2020. In the last version of the list, over 14 dimensions 
      were mapped to expressions, among which 5 were international classifications and 8 
      were other classifications for specific uses. The list became a central axis in the 
      electronic health record, being used for many different purposes linked to care, 
      such as surgical planning or emergency wards, or in research, for various 
      predictions using machine learning techniques. CONCLUSIONS: This study breaks with 
      common approaches primarily by focusing on real clinicians' language when expressing 
      patients' problems and secondarily by mapping whatever is required, including 
      controlled vocabularies to answer specific needs. This approach improves the quality 
      of the expression of patients' problems while allowing the building of as many 
      structured dimensions as needed to convey semantics according to specific contexts. 
      The method is shown to be scalable, sustainable, and efficient at hiding the 
      complexity of semantics or the burden of constraint-structured problem list entry 
      for clinicians. Ongoing work is analyzing the impact of this approach on how 
      clinicians express patients' problems.

TI  - TextHunter--A User Friendly Tool for Extracting Generic Concepts from Free Text in 
      Clinical Research.
PG  - 729-38
AB  - Observational research using data from electronic health records (EHR) is a rapidly 
      growing area, which promises both increased sample size and data richness - 
      therefore unprecedented study power. However, in many medical domains, large amounts 
      of potentially valuable data are contained within the free text clinical narrative. 
      Manually reviewing free text to obtain desired information is an inefficient use of 
      researcher time and skill. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of 
      applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract information. However, in real 
      world research environments, the demand for NLP skills outweighs supply, creating a 
      bottleneck in the secondary exploitation of the EHR. To address this, we present 
      TextHunter, a tool for the creation of training data, construction of concept 
      extraction machine learning models and their application to documents. Using 
      confidence thresholds to ensure high precision (>90%), we achieved recall 
      measurements as high as 99% in real world use cases.

TI  - MUDRLite - health record tailored to your particular needs.
PG  - 202-9
AB  - Nowadays most hospitals use electronic health records as part of their hospital 
      information systems. However, these systems are more suitable for hospital 
      management than for physicians. The health record is not sufficiently structured; it 
      includes a lot of free-text information, and the set of collected attributes is 
      fixed and practically impossible to extend. Physicians, gathering information for 
      the purpose of medical studies, often use varied proprietary solutions based on MS 
      Access databases or MS Excel Sheets. The EuroMISE Centre - Cardio is developing an 
      electronic health record (EHR) application called MUDRLite, which could easily fill 
      the gap between existing EHRs. MUDRLite is the result of applied research in the 
      field of EHR design, which is based on experience gathered during cooperation in the 
      TripleC project. MUDRLite development is an extra branch in the MUDR (MUltimedia 
      Distributed Record) development; it simplifies both the MUDR architecture and the 
      MUDR data storage principles.MUDRLite itself is an empty body, which has to be 
      filled in with an XML configuration file. This file completely describes the visual 
      aspects and the behavior of the EHR application. It includes simple 4GL-like 
      constructs written in the MUDRLite Language (MLL). This enables - using the 
      event-oriented programming principles - to program various handling procedures for a 
      range of actions, e.g. clicking a button fills a form with the result of an SQL 
      statement. MUDRLite can be tailored to particular needs of any healthcare provider. 
      This makes the MUDRLite application easy to use in specific environments. In the 
      first instance, we are testing it at the Neurovascular Department of the Central 
      Military Hospital in Prague.

LID - 10.1177/14604582211000785 [doi]
AB  - This research extracted patient-reported symptoms from free-text EHR notes of 
      colorectal and breast cancer patients and studied the correlation of the symptoms 
      with comorbid type 2 diabetes, race, and smoking status. An NLP framework was 
      developed first to use UMLS MetaMap to extract all symptom terms from the 366,398 
      EHR clinical notes of 1694 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and 3458 breast cancer 
      (BC) patients. Semantic analysis and clustering algorithms were then developed to 
      categorize all the relevant symptoms into eight symptom clusters defined by seed 
      terms. After all the relevant symptoms were extracted from the EHR clinical notes, 
      the frequency of the symptoms reported from colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast 
      cancer (BC) patients over three time-periods post-chemotherapy was calculated. 
      Logistic regression (LR) was performed with each symptom cluster as the response 
      variable while controlling for diabetes, race, and smoking status. The results show 
      that the CRC and BC patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) were more likely to report 
      symptoms than CRC and BC without T2D over three time-periods in the cancer 
      trajectory. We also found that current smokers were more likely to report anxiety 
      (CRC, BC), neuropathic symptoms (CRC, BC), anxiety (BC), and depression (BC) than 
      non-smokers.

TI  - Leveraging user's performance in reporting patient safety events by utilizing text 
      prediction in narrative data entry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Narrative data entry pervades computerized health information systems 
      and serves as a key component in collecting patient-related information in 
      electronic health records and patient safety event reporting systems. The quality 
      and efficiency of clinical data entry are critical in arriving at an optimal 
      diagnosis and treatment. The application of text prediction holds potential for 
      enhancing human performance of data entry in reporting patient safety events. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study examined two functions of text prediction intended for 
      increasing efficiency and data quality of text data entry reporting patient safety 
      events. METHODS: The study employed a two-group randomized design with 52 nurses. 
      The nurses were randomly assigned into a treatment group or a control group with a 
      task of reporting five patient fall cases in Chinese using a web-based test system, 
      with or without the prediction functions. T-test, Chi-square and linear regression 
      model were applied to evaluating the outcome differences in free-text data entry 
      between the groups. RESULTS: While both groups of participants exhibited a good 
      capacity for accomplishing the assigned task of reporting patient falls, the results 
      from the treatment group showed an overall increase of 70.5% in text generation 
      rate, an increase of 34.1% in reporting comprehensiveness score and a reduction of 
      14.5% in the non-adherence of the comment fields. The treatment group also showed an 
      increasing text generation rate over time, whereas no such an effect was observed in 
      the control group. CONCLUSION: As an attempt investigating the effectiveness of text 
      prediction functions in reporting patient safety events, the study findings proved 
      an effective strategy for assisting reporters in generating complementary free text 
      when reporting a patient safety event. The application of the strategy may be 
      effective in other clinical areas when free text entries are required.

PG  - 9461
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-89033-6 [doi]
LID - 9461
AB  - Efficient prediction of cancer recurrence in advance may help to recruit high risk 
      breast cancer patients for clinical trial on-time and can guide a proper treatment 
      plan. Several machine learning approaches have been developed for recurrence 
      prediction in previous studies, but most of them use only structured electronic 
      health records and only a small training dataset, with limited success in clinical 
      application. While free-text clinic notes may offer the greatest nuance and detail 
      about a patient's clinical status, they are largely excluded in previous predictive 
      models due to the increase in processing complexity and need for a complex modeling 
      framework. In this study, we developed a weak-supervision framework for breast 
      cancer recurrence prediction in which we trained a deep learning model on a large 
      sample of free-text clinic notes by utilizing a combination of manually curated 
      labels and NLP-generated non-perfect recurrence labels. The model was trained 
      jointly on manually curated data from 670 patients and NLP-curated data of 8062 
      patients. It was validated on manually annotated data from 224 patients with 
      recurrence and achieved 0.94 AUROC. This weak supervision approach allowed us to 
      learn from a larger dataset using imperfect labels and ultimately provided greater 
      accuracy compared to a smaller hand-curated dataset, with less manual effort 
      invested in curation.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI190283 [doi]
AB  - Coding accuracy in case-mix databases enables efficient funding of health facilities 
      and accurate epidemiological statistics based on patients' stays information. We 
      assume that the data collected in the electronic health record, especially drug 
      prescriptions and medical reports are relevant for checking the consistency of the 
      coding of diagnoses. We evaluated a new coding control tool, "TOLBIAC control", 
      embedded in the Web100T coding assistant. This tool interacts with the Vidal 
      Application Programming Interface and the electronic health record of the University 
      Hospital of Saint-Etienne. The micro-average F-measure was 0.76 for drug 
      prescriptions and 0.55 for free text medical reports. This initial evaluation has 
      revealed that drug prescriptions in EHRs can successfully be used to develop an 
      automated ICD-10 code-control tool. Nevertheless the "TOLBIAC control" tool is not 
      yet fully effective for widespread use because of its limited performance in text 
      analysis, a feature that is currently undergoing improvements.

TI  - Assessing the validity of national quality measures for coronary artery disease 
      using an electronic health record.
PG  - 2272-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nationally endorsed, clinical performance measures are available that 
      allow for quality reporting using electronic health records (EHRs). To our 
      knowledge, how well they reflect actual quality of care has not been studied. We 
      sought to evaluate the validity of performance measures for coronary artery disease 
      (CAD) using an ambulatory EHR. METHODS: We performed a retrospective electronic 
      medical chart review comparing automated measurement with a 2-step process of 
      automated measurement supplemented by review of free-text notes for apparent quality 
      failures for all patients with CAD from a large internal medicine practice using a 
      commercial EHR. The 7 performance measures included the following: antiplatelet 
      drug, lipid-lowering drug, beta-blocker following myocardial infarction, blood 
      pressure measurement, lipid measurement, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
      control, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker 
      for patients with diabetes mellitus or left ventricular systolic dysfunction. 
      RESULTS: Performance varied from 81.6% for lipid measurement to 97.6% for blood 
      pressure measurement based on automated measurement. A review of free-text notes for 
      cases failing an automated measure revealed that misclassification was common and 
      that 15% to 81% of apparent quality failures either satisfied the performance 
      measure or met valid exclusion criteria. After including free-text data, the 
      adherence rate ranged from 87.5% for lipid measurement and low-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol control to 99.2% for blood pressure measurement. CONCLUSIONS: Profiling 
      the quality of outpatient CAD care using data from an EHR has significant 
      limitations. Changes in how data are routinely recorded in an EHR are needed to 
      improve the accuracy of this type of quality measurement. Validity testing in 
      different settings is required.

TI  - Physician nurse care: A new use of UMLS to measure professional contribution: Are we 
      talking about the same patient a new graph matching algorithm?
PG  - 63-71

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physician and nurses have worked together for generations; however, 
      their language and training are vastly different; comparing and contrasting their 
      work and their joint impact on patient outcomes is difficult in light of this 
      difference. At the same time, the EHR only includes the physician perspective via 
      the physician-authored discharge summary, but not nurse documentation. Prior 
      research in this area has focused on collaboration and the usage of similar 
      terminology. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to gain insight into 
      interprofessional care by developing a computational metric to identify 
      similarities, related concepts and differences in physician and nurse work. METHODS: 
      58 physician discharge summaries and the corresponding nurse plans of care were 
      transformed into Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifiers 
      (CUIs). MedLEE, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) program, extracted "physician 
      terms" from free-text physician summaries. The nursing plans of care were 
      constructed using the HANDS(©) nursing documentation software. HANDS(©) utilizes 
      structured terminologies: nursing diagnosis (NANDA-I), outcomes (NOC), and 
      interventions (NIC) to create "nursing terms". The physician's and nurse's terms 
      were compared using the UMLS network for relatedness, overlaying the physician and 
      nurse terms for comparison. Our overarching goal is to provide insight into the 
      care, by innovatively applying graph algorithms to the UMLS network. We reveal the 
      relationships between the care provided by each professional that is specific to the 
      patient level. RESULTS: We found that only 26% of patients had synonyms (identical 
      UMLS CUIs) between the two professions' documentation. On average, physicians' 
      discharge summaries contain 27 terms and nurses' documentation, 18. Traversing the 
      UMLS network, we found an average of 4 terms related (distance less than 2) between 
      the professions, leaving most concepts as unrelated between nurse and physician 
      care. CONCLUSION: Our hypothesis that physician's and nurse's practice domains are 
      markedly different is supported by the preliminary, quantitative evidence we found. 
      Leveraging the UMLS network and graph traversal algorithms, allows us to compare and 
      contrast nursing and physician care on a single patient, enabling a more complete 
      picture of patient care. We can differentiate professional contributions to patient 
      outcomes and related and divergent concepts by each profession.

      professionals.
PG  - 465-9
AB  - Supporting data entry by clinicians is considered one of the greatest challenges in 
      implementing electronic health records. In this paper we describe a formative 
      evaluation study using three different methodologies through which we identified 
      obstacles to point-of-care data entry for eye care and then used the formative 
      process to develop and test solutions to overcome these obstacles. The greatest 
      obstacles were supporting free text annotation of clinical observations and 
      accommodating the creation of detailed diagrams in multiple colors. To support free 
      text entry, we arrived at an approach that captures an image of a free text note and 
      associates this image with related data elements in an encounter note. The detailed 
      diagrams included a color pallet that allowed changing pen color with a single 
      stroke and also captured the diagrams as an image associated with related data 
      elements. During observed sessions with simulated patients, these approaches 
      satisfied the clinicians' documentation needs by capturing the full range of 
      clinical complexity that arises in practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Comparative effectiveness research (CER) requires the capture and 
      analysis of data from disparate sources, often from a variety of institutions with 
      diverse electronic health record (EHR) implementations. In this paper we describe 
      the CER Hub, a web-based informatics platform for developing and conducting research 
      studies that combine comprehensive electronic clinical data from multiple health 
      care organizations. METHODS: The CER Hub platform implements a data processing 
      pipeline that employs informatics standards for data representation and web-based 
      tools for developing study-specific data processing applications, providing 
      standardized access to the patient-centric electronic health record (EHR) across 
      organizations. RESULTS: The CER Hub is being used to conduct two CER studies 
      utilizing data from six geographically distributed and demographically diverse 
      health systems. These foundational studies address the effectiveness of medications 
      for controlling asthma and the effectiveness of smoking cessation services delivered 
      in primary care. DISCUSSION: The CER Hub includes four key capabilities: the ability 
      to process and analyze both free-text and coded clinical data in the EHR; a data 
      processing environment supported by distributed data and study governance processes; 
      a clinical data-interchange format for facilitating standardized extraction of 
      clinical data from EHRs; and a library of shareable clinical data processing 
      applications. CONCLUSION: CER requires coordinated and scalable methods for 
      extracting, aggregating, and analyzing complex, multi-institutional clinical data. 
      By offering a range of informatics tools integrated into a framework for conducting 
      studies using EHR data, the CER Hub provides a solution to the challenges of 
      multi-institutional research using electronic medical record data.

TI  - Data Management for Applications of Patient Reported Outcomes.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.5334/egems.201 [doi]
LID - 5
AB  - CONTEXT: Patient reported outcomes (PROs) are one means of systematically gathering 
      meaningful subjective information for patient care, population health, and patient 
      centered outcomes research. However, optimal data management for effective PRO 
      applications is unclear. CASE DESCRIPTION: Delivery systems associated with the 
      Health Care Systems Research Network (HCSRN) have implemented PRO data collection as 
      part of the Medicare annual Health Risk Assessment (HRA). A questionnaire assessed 
      data content, collection, storage, and extractability in HCSRN delivery systems. 
      FINDINGS: Responses were received from 15 (83.3 percent) of 18 sites. The proportion 
      of Medicare beneficiaries completing an HRA ranged from less than 10 to 42 percent. 
      Most sites collected core HRA elements and 10 collected information on additional 
      domains such as social support. Measures for core domains varied across sites. Data 
      were collected at and prior to visits. Modes included paper, clinician entry, 
      patient portals, and interactive voice response. Data were stored in the electronic 
      health record (EHR) in scanned documents, free text, and discrete fields, and in 
      summary databases. MAJOR THEMES: PRO implementation requires effectively collecting, 
      storing, extracting, and applying patient-reported data. Standardizing PRO measures 
      and storing data in extractable formats can facilitate multi-site uses for PRO data, 
      while access to individual PROs in the EHR may be sufficient for use at the point of 
      care. CONCLUSION: Collecting comparable PRO data elements, storing data in 
      extractable fields, and collecting data from a higher proportion of eligible 
      respondents represents an optimal approach to support multi-site applications of PRO 
      information.

TI  - Automated Coding of Under-Studied Medical Concept Domains: Linking Physical Activity 
      Reports to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health.
LID - 620828 [pii]

AB  - Linking clinical narratives to standardized vocabularies and coding systems is a key 
      component of unlocking the information in medical text for analysis. However, many 
      domains of medical concepts, such as functional outcomes and social determinants of 
      health, lack well-developed terminologies that can support effective coding of 
      medical text. We present a framework for developing natural language processing 
      (NLP) technologies for automated coding of medical information in under-studied 
      domains, and demonstrate its applicability through a case study on physical mobility 
      function. Mobility function is a component of many health measures, from post-acute 
      care and surgical outcomes to chronic frailty and disability, and is represented as 
      one domain of human activity in the International Classification of Functioning, 
      Disability, and Health (ICF). However, mobility and other types of functional 
      activity remain under-studied in the medical informatics literature, and neither the 
      ICF nor commonly-used medical terminologies capture functional status terminology in 
      practice. We investigated two data-driven paradigms, classification and candidate 
      selection, to link narrative observations of mobility status to standardized ICF 
      codes, using a dataset of clinical narratives from physical therapy encounters. 
      Recent advances in language modeling and word embedding were used as features for 
      established machine learning models and a novel deep learning approach, achieving a 
      macro-averaged F-1 score of 84% on linking mobility activity reports to ICF codes. 
      Both classification and candidate selection approaches present distinct strengths 
      for automated coding in under-studied domains, and we highlight that the combination 
      of (i) a small annotated data set; (ii) expert definitions of codes of interest; and 
      (iii) a representative text corpus is sufficient to produce high-performing 
      automated coding systems. This research has implications for continued development 
      of language technologies to analyze functional status information, and the ongoing 
      growth of NLP tools for a variety of specialized applications in clinical care and 
      research.

TI  - Can structured data fields accurately measure quality of care? The example of falls.
PG  - 1411-20
AB  - By automating collection of data elements, electronic health records may simplify 
      the process of measuring the quality of medical care. Using data from a quality 
      improvement initiative in primary care medical groups, we sought to determine 
      whether the quality of care for falls and fear of falling in outpatients aged 75 and 
      older could be accurately measured solely from codable (non-free-text) data in a 
      structured visit note. A traditional medical record review by trained abstractors 
      served as the criterion standard. Among 215 patient records reviewed, we found a 
      structured visit note in 54% of charts within 3 mo of the date patients had been 
      identified as having falls or fear of falling. The reliability of an algorithm based 
      on codable data was at least good (kappa of at least 0.61) compared with full 
      medical record review for three care processes recommended for patients with two 
      falls or one fall with injury in the past year: orthostatic vital signs, vision 
      test/eye examination, and home safety evaluation. However, the automated algorithm 
      routinely underestimated quality of care. Performance standards based on automated 
      measurement of quality of care from electronic health records need to account for 
      documentation occurring in nonstructured form.

TI  - Identifying patients with hypertension: a case for auditing electronic health record 
      data.
PG  - 1e
LID - 1e
AB  - Problems in the structure, consistency, and completeness of electronic health record 
      data are barriers to outcomes research, quality improvement, and practice redesign. 
      This nonexperimental retrospective study examines the utility of importing 
      de-identified electronic health record data into an external system to identify 
      patients with and at risk for essential hypertension. We find a statistically 
      significant increase in cases based on combined use of diagnostic and free-text 
      coding (mean = 1,256.1, 95% CI 1,232.3-1,279.7) compared to diagnostic coding alone 
      (mean = 1,174.5, 95% CI 1,150.5-1,198.3). While it is not surprising that 
      significantly more patients are identified when broadening search criteria, the 
      implications are critical for quality of care, the movement toward the National 
      Committee for Quality Assurance's Patient-Centered Medical Home program, and 
      meaningful use of electronic health records. Further, we find a statistically 
      significant increase in potential cases based on the last two or more blood pressure 
      readings greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg (mean = 1,353.9, 95% CI 
      1,329.9-1,377.9).

TI  - Managing the tensions between national standardization vs. regional localization of 
      clinical content and templates.
PG  - 1081-5
AB  - The deployment of sophisticated software tools and electronic health records offers 
      many new opportunities and challenges to support care delivery. One of the key 
      opportunities is to enhance the quality of care with evidence-based medicine (EBM). 
      One of the key challenges is to embed EBM in tools that directly facilitate the 
      process of documentation and care delivery. Since clinicians typically have the 
      option of using free text for most of their documentation, the tools that provide 
      embedded EBM must be at least as efficient as free text. There are many requirements 
      that must be met in order to effectively embed EBM within clinical content tools and 
      enhance both the usability and the actual use of such tools and clinical content: 
      (1) Facilitate the documentation process; (2) Facilitate the care delivery process, 
      e.g. make order entry faster; (3) Contain recommendations that are highly relevant 
      to the clinical context of an encounter; (4) Aid in the capture of discrete coded 
      data. Support for local variation is often key to meeting these objectives and 
      becomes a central factor in helping clinicians shift from unstructured free text, to 
      the use of these tools, which support the delivery of EBM. This document describes 
      the central tension between the objective of national standardization and delivery 
      of EBM and the need for regional localization of clinical content. This tension must 
      be thoughtfully managed to maximize the quality of care delivery and associated 
      workflow practices. The key elements of legitimate local variation that must be 
      recognized in order to achieve these goals are described in this document, and the 
      key principles for managing the tensions between generalization and localization are 
      identified.

TI  - Development of an algorithm to assess unmeasured symptom severity in gynecologic 
      care.
LID - S0002-9378(21)01214-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ajog.2021.11.020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disparities research is often limited by incomplete accounting for 
      differences in health status by populations. In the U.S., hysterectomy shows marked 
      variation by race and geography, but it is difficult to understand what factors 
      cause these variations without accounting for differences in the severity of 
      gynecologic symptoms that drive hysterectomy decision-making. OBJECTIVE: Our 
      objective is to demonstrate a method for using electronic health record 
      (EHR)-derived data to create composite symptom severity indices to more fully 
      capture relevant markers that influence the decision for hysterectomy. STUDY DESIGN: 
      This was a retrospective cohort study of 1,993 people who underwent hysterectomy 
      between April 4, 2014 and December 31, 2017 from ten hospitals and over 100 
      outpatient clinics in North Carolina. EHR data including billing, pharmacy, 
      laboratory data, and free text notes, were used to identify markers of 3 common 
      indications for hysterectomy: bulk symptoms (pressure from uterine enlargement), 
      vaginal bleeding, and pelvic pain. To develop weighted symptom indices, we finalized 
      a scoring algorithm based on the relationship of each marker to an objective 
      measure, in combination with clinical expertise, with the goal of composite symptom 
      severity indices that had sufficient variation to be useful in comparing different 
      patient groups and allow discrimination between more or less severe symptoms of 
      bulk, bleeding, or pain. RESULTS: Ranges of symptom severity scores varied across 
      the three indices; including composite bulk score (0 to 14), vaginal bleeding score 
      (0 to 44) and pain score (0 to 30). Mean values of each composite symptom severity 
      index were greater for those who had diagnostic codes for vaginal bleeding, bulk 
      symptoms, or pelvic pain, respectively. However, each index also demonstrated 
      variation across the entire group of hysterectomy cases and identified symptoms that 
      ranged in severity among those with and without the target diagnostic codes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging multisource data to create composite symptom severity 
      indices provided greater discriminatory power to assess common gynecologic 
      indications for hysterectomy. These methods can advance understanding in healthcare 
      use in the setting of long-standing inequities and be applied across populations to 
      account for previously unexplained variation across race, geography, and other 
      social indicators.

TI  - Variation in Documenting Diagnosable Chronic Kidney Disease in General Medical 
      Practice: Implications for Quality Improvement and Research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: National health surveys indicate that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an 
      increasingly prevalent condition in Australia, placing a significant burden on the 
      health budget and on the affected individuals themselves. Yet, there are relatively 
      limited data on the prevalence of CKD within Australian general practice patients. 
      In part, this could be due to variation in the terminology used by general 
      practitioners (GPs) to identify and document a diagnosis of CKD. This project sought 
      to investigate the variation in terms used when recording a diagnosis of CKD in 
      general practice. METHODS: A search of routinely collected de-identified Australian 
      general practice patient data (NPS MedicineWise MedicineInsight from January 1, 
      2013, to June 1, 2016; collected from 329 general practices) was conducted to 
      determine the terms used. Manual searches were conducted on coded and on "free-text" 
      or narrative information in the medical history, reason for encounter, and reason 
      for prescription data fields. RESULTS: From this data set, 61 102 patients were 
      potentially diagnosable with CKD on the basis of pathology results, but only 14 172 
      (23.2%) of these had a term representing CKD in their electronic record. Younger 
      patients with pathology evidence of CKD were more likely to have documented CKD 
      compared with older patients. There were a total of 2090 unique recorded 
      documentation terms used by the GPs for CKD. The most commonly used terms tended to 
      be those included as "pick-list" options within the various general practice 
      software packages' standard "classifications," accounting for 84% of use. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of CKD was often not documented and, when recorded, it was 
      in a variety of ways. While recording CKD with various terms and in free-text fields 
      may allow GPs to flexibly document disease qualifiers and enter patient specific 
      information, it might inadvertently decrease the quality of data collected from 
      general practice records for clinical audit or research purposes.

AB  - Data mining is a powerful tool to reduce costs and mitigate errors in the diagnostic 
      analysis and repair of complex engineered system, but it has yet to be applied 
      systematically to the most complex and socially expensive system - the human body. 
      The currently available approaches of knowledge-based and pattern-based artificial 
      intelligence are unsuited to the iterative and often subjective nature of 
      clinician-patient interactions. Furthermore, current electronic health records 
      generally have poor design and low quality for such data mining. Bayesian methods 
      have been developed to suggest multiple possible diagnoses given a set of clinical 
      findings, but the larger problem is advising the physician on useful next steps. A 
      new approach based on inverting Bayesian inference allows identification of the 
      diagnostic actions that are most likely to disambiguate a differential diagnosis at 
      each point in a patient's work-up. This can be combined with personalized cost 
      information to suggest a cost-effective path to the clinician. Because the software 
      is tracking the clinician's decision-making process, it can provide salient 
      suggestions for both diagnoses and diagnostic tests in standard, coded formats that 
      need only to be selected. This would reduce the need to type in free text, which is 
      prone to ambiguities, omissions and errors. As the database of high-quality records 
      grows, the scope, utility and acceptance of the system should also grow 
      automatically, without requiring expert updating or correction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We present the Clinical Trial Knowledge Base, a regularly updated 
      knowledge base of discrete clinical trial eligibility criteria equipped with a 
      web-based user interface for querying and aggregate analysis of common eligibility 
      criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a natural language processing (NLP) tool 
      named Criteria2Query (Yuan et al., 2019) to transform free text clinical trial 
      eligibility criteria from ClinicalTrials.gov into discrete criteria concepts and 
      attributes encoded using the widely adopted Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) and stored in a relational SQL database. 
      A web application accessible via RESTful APIs was implemented to enable queries and 
      visual aggregate analyses. We demonstrate CTKB's potential role in EHR phenotype 
      knowledge engineering using ten validated phenotyping algorithms. RESULTS: At the 
      time of writing, CTKB contained 87,504 distinctive OMOP CDM standard concepts, 
      including Condition (47.82%), Drug (23.01%), Procedure (13.73%), Measurement 
      (24.70%) and Observation (5.28%), with 34.78% for inclusion criteria and 65.22% for 
      exclusion criteria, extracted from 352,110 clinical trials. The average hit rate of 
      criteria concepts in eMERGE phenotype algorithms is 77.56%. CONCLUSION: CTKB is a 
      novel comprehensive knowledge base of discrete eligibility criteria concepts with 
      the potential to enable knowledge engineering for clinical trial cohort definition, 
      clinical trial population representativeness assessment, electronical phenotyping, 
      and data gap analyses for using electronic health records to support clinical trial 
      recruitment.

TI  - Developing Methods of Repurposing Electronic Health Record Data for Identification 
      of Older Adults at Risk of Unintentional Falls.
PG  - 1b
LID - 1b
AB  - Nationally, nearly 40 percent of community-dwelling adults age 65 and older fall at 
      least once a year, making unintentional falls the leading cause of both fatal and 
      nonfatal injuries among this age group. Addressing this public health problem in 
      primary care offers promise. However, challenges in incorporating fall risk 
      screening into primary care result in a problem of missed opportunities for 
      screening, counseling, intervention, and ultimately prevention. Given these 
      barriers, this study examines the potential for the innovative use of routinely 
      collected electronic health record data to provide enhanced clinical decision 
      support in busy, often resource-thin primary care environments. Using de-identified 
      data from a sample of West Virginia primary care centers, we find that it is both 
      feasible and worthwhile to repurpose routinely collected data for the purpose of 
      identification of older adults at risk of falls. Searching of both free-text and 
      semistructured data was particularly valuable.

TI  - Assessment of Patients' Ability to Review Electronic Health Record Information to 
      Identify Potential Errors: Cross-sectional Web-Based Survey.
PG  - e19074
LID - 10.2196/19074 [doi]
LID - e19074
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sharing personal health information positively impacts quality of care 
      across several domains, and particularly, safety and patient-centeredness. Patients 
      may identify and flag up inconsistencies in their electronic health records (EHRs), 
      leading to improved information quality and patient safety. However, in order to 
      identify potential errors, patients need to be able to understand the information 
      contained in their EHRs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess patients' 
      perceptions of their ability to understand the information contained in their EHRs 
      and to analyze the main barriers to their understanding. Additionally, the main 
      types of patient-reported errors were characterized. METHODS: A cross-sectional 
      web-based survey was undertaken between March 2017 and September 2017. A total of 
      682 registered users of the Care Information Exchange, a patient portal, with at 
      least one access during the time of the study were invited to complete the survey 
      containing both structured (multiple choice) and unstructured (free text) questions. 
      The survey contained questions on patients' perceived ability to understand their 
      EHR information and therefore, to identify errors. Free-text questions allowed 
      respondents to expand on the reasoning for their structured responses and provide 
      more detail about their perceptions of EHRs and identifying errors within them. 
      Qualitative data were systematically reviewed by 2 independent researchers using the 
      framework analysis method in order to identify emerging themes. RESULTS: A total of 
      210 responses were obtained. The majority of the responses (123/210, 58.6%) reported 
      understanding of the information. The main barriers identified were 
      information-related (medical terminology and knowledge and interpretation of test 
      results) and technology-related (user-friendliness of the portal, information 
      display). Inconsistencies relating to incomplete and incorrect information were 
      reported in 12.4% (26/210) of the responses. CONCLUSIONS: While the majority of the 
      responses affirmed the understanding of the information contained within the EHRs, 
      both technology and information-based barriers persist. There is a potential to 
      improve the system design to better support opportunities for patients to identify 
      errors. This is with the aim of improving the accuracy, quality, and timeliness of 
      the information held in the EHRs and a mechanism to further engage patients in their 
      health care.

TI  - Physicians' perceptions of the impact of the EHR on the collection and retrieval of 
      psychosocial information in outpatient diabetes care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychosocial information informs clinical decisions by providing crucial 
      context for patients' barriers to recommended self-care; this is especially 
      important in outpatient diabetes care because outcomes are largely dependent upon 
      self-care behavior. Little is known about provider perceptions of use of 
      psychosocial information. Further, while EHRs have dramatically changed how 
      providers interact with patient health information, the EHRs' role in collection and 
      retrieval of psychosocial information is not understood. METHODS: We designed a 
      qualitative study. We used semi-structured interviews to investigate physicians' 
      (N = 17) perspectives on the impact of EHR for psychosocial information use for 
      outpatient Type II diabetes care decisions. We selected the constant comparative 
      method to analyze the data. FINDINGS: Psychosocial information is perceived as 
      dissimilar from other clinical information such as HbA1c and prescribed medications. 
      Its narrative form conveys the patient's story, which elucidates barriers to 
      following self-care recommendations. The narrative is abstract, and requires 
      interpretation of patterns. Psychosocial information is also circumstantial; hence, 
      the patients' context determines influence on self-care. Furthermore, EHRs can 
      impair the collection of psychosocial information because the designs of EHR tools 
      make it difficult to document, search for, and retrieve it. Templates do not enable 
      users from collecting the patient's 'story', and using free text fields is time 
      consuming. Providers therefore had low use of, and confidence in, the accuracy of 
      psychosocial information in the EHR. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: Workflows and EHR tools 
      should be re-designed to better support psychosocial information collection and 
      retrieval. Tools should enable recording and summarization of the patient's story, 
      and the rationale for treatment decisions.

TI  - What does validation of cases in electronic record databases mean? The potential 
      contribution of free text.
PG  - 321-4
LID - 10.1002/pds.2086 [doi]
AB  - Electronic health records are increasingly used for research. The definition of 
      cases or endpoints often relies on the use of coded diagnostic data, using a 
      pre-selected group of codes. Validation of these cases, as 'true' cases of the 
      disease, is crucial. There are, however, ambiguities in what is meant by validation 
      in the context of electronic records. Validation usually implies comparison of a 
      definition against a gold standard of diagnosis and the ability to identify false 
      negatives ('true' cases which were not detected) as well as false positives 
      (detected cases which did not have the condition). We argue that two separate 
      concepts of validation are often conflated in existing studies. Firstly, whether the 
      GP thought the patient was suffering from a particular condition (which we term 
      confirmation or internal validation) and secondly, whether the patient really had 
      the condition (external validation). Few studies have the ability to detect false 
      negatives who have not received a diagnostic code. Natural language processing is 
      likely to open up the use of free text within the electronic record which will 
      facilitate both the validation of the coded diagnosis and searching for false 
      negatives.

TI  - Meaningful use of a standardized terminology to support the electronic health record 
      in new zealand.
PG  - 368-76
LID - 10.4338/ACI-2010-06-CR-0035 [doi]
AB  - Meaningful use is a multidimensional concept that incorporates complex processes; 
      workflow; interoperability; decision support; performance evaluation; and quality 
      improvement. Meaningful use is congruent with the overall vision for information 
      management in New Zealand. Health practitioners interface with patient information 
      at many levels, and are pivotal to meaningful use at the interface between service 
      providers, patients, and the electronic health record. Advancing towards meaningful 
      use depends on implementing a meaningful interface terminology within the electronic 
      health record. The Omaha System is an interface terminology that is integrated 
      within Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT(®)), and 
      has the capacity to disseminate and capture information at the point of care because 
      its codes are simple defined terms. Two community nursing and allied health 
      providers who are considering using the Omaha System in clinical systems for 
      gathering intervention and outcomes data within the personal EHR include Nurse Maude 
      and the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society. Help4U is investigating using the Omaha 
      System as a way to standardise health terminology for consumer use. The Omaha System 
      is also a good fit with the Midwifery and Maternity Providers Organisation (MMPO) 
      existing clinical information system to describe and capture data about 
      interventions currently recorded as free text. As a country that promotes access to 
      affordable primary care and free hospital care, within an environment constrained by 
      resource limitations, maximizing the use of data is key to demonstrating health 
      outcomes for the population.

TI  - Machine learning optimization of an electronic health record audit for heart failure 
      in primary care.
LID - 10.1002/ehf2.13724 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The diagnosis of heart failure (HF) is an important problem in primary care. 
      We previously demonstrated a 74% increase in registered HF diagnoses in primary care 
      electronic health records (EHRs) following an extended audit procedure. What remains 
      unclear is the accuracy of registered HF pre-audit and which EHR variables are most 
      important in the extended audit strategy. This study aims to describe the diagnostic 
      HF classification sequence at different stages, assess general practitioner (GP) HF 
      misclassification, and test the predictive performance of an optimized audit. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a secondary analysis of the OSCAR-HF study, a 
      prospective observational trial including 51 participating GPs. OSCAR used an 
      extended audit based on typical HF risk factors, signs, symptoms, and medications in 
      GPs' EHR. This resulted in a list of possible HF patients, which participating GPs 
      had to classify as HF or non-HF. We compared registered HF diagnoses before and 
      after GPs' assessment. For our analysis of audit performance, we used GPs' 
      assessment of HF as primary outcome and audit queries as dichotomous predictor 
      variables for a gradient boosted machine (GBM) decision tree algorithm and logistic 
      regression model. Of the 18 011 patients eligible for the audit intervention, 4678 
      (26.0%) were identified as possible HF patients and submitted for GPs' assessment in 
      the audit stage. There were 310 patients with registered HF before GP assessment, of 
      whom 146 (47.1%) were judged not to have HF by their GP (over-registration). There 
      were 538 patients with registered HF after GP assessment, of whom 374 (69.5%) did 
      not have registered HF before GP assessment (under-registration). The GBM and 
      logistic regression model had a comparable predictive performance (area under the 
      curve of 0.70 [95% confidence interval 0.65-0.77] and 0.69 [95% confidence interval 
      0.64-0.75], respectively). This was not significantly impacted by reducing the set 
      of predictor variables to the 10 most important variables identified in the GBM 
      model (free-text and coded cardiomyopathy, ischaemic heart disease and atrial 
      fibrillation, digoxin, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and combinations of 
      renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and beta-blockers with diuretics). This 
      optimized query set was enough to identify 86% (n = 461/538) of GPs' self-assessed 
      HF population with a 33% reduction (n = 1537/4678) in screening caseload. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic coding of HF in primary care health records is inaccurate 
      with a high degree of under-registration and over-registration. An optimized query 
      set enabled identification of more than 80% of GPs' self-assessed HF population.

TI  - Supporting the use of standardized nursing terminologies with automatic subject 
      heading prediction: a comparison of sentence-level text classification methods.
PG  - 81-88
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocz150 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study focuses on the task of automatically assigning standardized 
      (topical) subject headings to free-text sentences in clinical nursing notes. The 
      underlying motivation is to support nurses when they document patient care by 
      developing a computer system that can assist in incorporating suitable subject 
      headings that reflect the documented topics. Central in this study is performance 
      evaluation of several text classification methods to assess the feasibility of 
      developing such a system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven text classification methods 
      are evaluated using a corpus of approximately 0.5 million nursing notes (5.5 million 
      sentences) with 676 unique headings extracted from a Finnish university hospital. 
      Several of these methods are based on artificial neural networks. Evaluation is 
      first done in an automatic manner for all methods, then a manual error analysis is 
      done on a sample. RESULTS: We find that a method based on a bidirectional long 
      short-term memory network performs best with an average recall of 0.5435 when 
      allowed to suggest 1 subject heading per sentence and 0.8954 when allowed to suggest 
      10 subject headings per sentence. However, other methods achieve comparable results. 
      The manual analysis indicates that the predictions are better than what the 
      automatic evaluation suggests. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that several of the 
      tested methods perform well in suggesting the most appropriate subject headings on 
      sentence level. Thus, we find it feasible to develop a text classification system 
      that can support the use of standardized terminologies and save nurses time and 
      effort on care documentation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Drug safety research asks causal questions but relies on observational 
      data. Confounding bias threatens the reliability of studies using such data. The 
      successful control of confounding requires knowledge of variables called confounders 
      affecting both the exposure and outcome of interest. However, causal knowledge of 
      dynamic biological systems is complex and challenging. Fortunately, computable 
      knowledge mined from the literature may hold clues about confounders. In this paper, 
      we tested the hypothesis that incorporating literature-derived confounders can 
      improve causal inference from observational data. METHODS: We introduce two methods 
      (semantic vector-based and string-based confounder search) that query 
      literature-derived information for confounder candidates to control, using SemMedDB, 
      a database of computable knowledge mined from the biomedical literature. These 
      methods search SemMedDB for confounders by applying semantic constraint search for 
      indications treated by the drug (exposure) and that are also known to cause the 
      adverse event (outcome). We then include the literature-derived confounder 
      candidates in statistical and causal models derived from free-text clinical notes. 
      For evaluation, we use a reference dataset widely used in drug safety containing 
      labeled pairwise relationships between drugs and adverse events and attempt to 
      rediscover these relationships from a corpus of 2.2 M NLP-processed free-text 
      clinical notes. We employ standard adjustment and causal inference procedures to 
      predict and estimate causal effects by informing the models with varying numbers of 
      literature-derived confounders and instantiating the exposure, outcome, and 
      confounder variables in the models with dichotomous EHR-derived data. Finally, we 
      compare the results from applying these procedures with naive measures of 
      association (χ(2) and reporting odds ratio) and with each other. RESULTS AND 
      CONCLUSIONS: We found semantic vector-based search to be superior to string-based 
      search at reducing confounding bias. However, the effect of including more rather 
      than fewer literature-derived confounders was inconclusive. We recommend using 
      targeted learning estimation methods that can address treatment-confounder feedback, 
      where confounders also behave as intermediate variables, and engaging subject-matter 
      experts to adjudicate the handling of problematic covariates.

TI  - Standard Information Models for Representing Adverse Sensitivity Information in 
      Clinical Documents.
PG  - 151-7
LID - 10.3414/ME15-01-0081 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse sensitivity (e.g., allergy and intolerance) information is a 
      critical component of any electronic health record system. While several standards 
      exist for structured entry of adverse sensitivity information, many clinicians 
      record this data as free text. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to 1) identify and 
      compare the existing common adverse sensitivity information models, and 2) to 
      evaluate the coverage of the adverse sensitivity information models for representing 
      allergy information on a subset of inpatient and outpatient adverse sensitivity 
      clinical notes. METHODS: We compared four common adverse sensitivity information 
      models: Health Level 7 Allergy and Intolerance Domain Analysis Model, HL7-DAM; the 
      Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, FHIR; the Consolidated Continuity of 
      Care Document, C-CDA; and OpenEHR, and evaluated their coverage on a corpus of 
      inpatient and outpatient notes (n = 120). RESULTS: We found that allergy 
      specialists' notes had the highest frequency of adverse sensitivity attributes per 
      note, whereas emergency department notes had the fewest attributes. Overall, the 
      models had many similarities in the central attributes which covered between 75% and 
      95% of adverse sensitivity information contained within the notes. However, 
      representations of some attributes (especially the value-sets) were not well aligned 
      between the models, which is likely to present an obstacle for achieving data 
      interoperability. Also, adverse sensitivity exceptions were not well represented 
      among the information models. CONCLUSIONS: Although we found that common adverse 
      sensitivity models cover a significant portion of relevant information in the 
      clinical notes, our results highlight areas needed to be reconciled between the 
      standards for data interoperability.

TI  - Which Chart Elements Accurately Identify Emergency Department Visits for Suicidal 
      Ideation or Behavior?
PG  - 382-390
LID - 10.1080/13811118.2018.1472691 [doi]
AB  - In an emergency department (ED) sample, we investigated the concordance between 
      identification of suicide-related visits through standardized comprehensive chart 
      review versus a subset of 3 specific chart elements: ICD-9-CM codes, free-text 
      presenting complaints, and free-text physician discharge diagnoses. The method for 
      this study was review of medical records for adults (≥18 years) at 8 EDs across the 
      United States. A total of 3,776 charts were reviewed. A combination of the 3 chart 
      elements (ICD-9-CM, presenting complaints, and discharge diagnoses) provided the 
      most robust data with 85% sensitivity, 96% specificity, 92% PPV, and 92% NPV. These 
      findings highlight the use of key discrete fields in the medical record that can be 
      extracted to facilitate identification of whether an ED visit was suicide-related.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Increased adoption of electronic health records has resulted in 
      increased availability of free text clinical data for secondary use. A variety of 
      approaches to obtain actionable information from unstructured free text data exist. 
      These approaches are resource intensive, inherently complex and rely on structured 
      clinical data and dictionary-based approaches. We sought to evaluate the potential 
      to obtain actionable information from free text pathology reports using routinely 
      available tools and approaches that do not depend on dictionary-based approaches. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained pathology reports from a large health information 
      exchange and evaluated the capacity to detect cancer cases from these reports using 
      3 non-dictionary feature selection approaches, 4 feature subset sizes, and 5 
      clinical decision models: simple logistic regression, naïve bayes, k-nearest 
      neighbor, random forest, and J48 decision tree. The performance of each decision 
      model was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive 
      value, and area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. RESULTS: 
      Decision models parameterized using automated, informed, and manual feature 
      selection approaches yielded similar results. Furthermore, non-dictionary 
      classification approaches identified cancer cases present in free text reports with 
      evaluation measures approaching and exceeding 80-90% for most metrics. CONCLUSION: 
      Our methods are feasible and practical approaches for extracting substantial 
      information value from free text medical data, and the results suggest that these 
      methods can perform on par, if not better, than existing dictionary-based 
      approaches. Given that public health agencies are often under-resourced and lack the 
      technical capacity for more complex methodologies, these results represent 
      potentially significant value to the public health field.

TI  - ICIPEMIR: Improving the Completeness, Interoperability and Patient Explanations of 
      Medical Imaging Reports.
PG  - 422-426
LID - 10.3233/SHTI210193 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although electronic health records have been facilitating the 
      management of medical information, there is still room for improvement in daily 
      production of medical report. Possible areas for improvement would be: to improve 
      reports quality (by increasing exhaustivity), to improve patients' understanding (by 
      mean of a graphical display), to save physicians' time (by helping reports writing), 
      and to improve sharing and storage (by enhancing interoperability). We set up the 
      ICIPEMIR project (Improving the completeness, interoperability and patients 
      explanation of medical imaging reports) as an academic solution to optimize medical 
      imaging reports production. Such a project requires two layers: one engineering 
      layer to build the automation process, and a second medical layer to determine 
      domain-specific data models for each type of report. We describe here the medical 
      layer of this project. METHODS: We designed a reproducible methodology to identify 
      -for a given medical imaging exam- mandatory fields, and describe a corresponding 
      simple data model using validated formats. The mandatory fields had to meet legal 
      requirements, domain-specific guidelines, and results of a bibliographic review on 
      clinical studies. An UML representation, a JSON Schema, and a YAML instance dataset 
      were defined. Based on this data model a form was created using Goupile, an open 
      source eCRF script-based editor. In addition, a graphical display was designed and 
      mapped with the data model, as well as a text template to automatically produce a 
      free-text report. Finally, the YAML instance was encoded in a QR-Code to allow 
      offline paper-based transmission of structured data. RESULTS: We tested this 
      methodology in a specific domain: computed tomography for urolithiasis. We 
      successfully extracted 73 fields, and transformed them into a simple data model, 
      with mapping to a simple graphical display, and textual report template. The offline 
      QR-code transmission of a 2,615 characters YAML file was successful with simple 
      smartphone QR-Code scanner. CONCLUSION: Although automated production of medical 
      report requires domain-specific data model and mapping, these can be defined using a 
      reproducible methodology. Hopefully this proof of concept will lead to a computer 
      solution to optimize medical imaging reports, driven by academic research.

TI  - Diagnosis Documentation of Critically Ill Children at Admission to a PICU.
LID - 10.1097/PCC.0000000000002812 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Multidisciplinary PICU teams must effectively share information while 
      caring for critically ill children. Clinical documentation helps clinicians develop 
      a shared understanding of the patient's diagnosis, which informs decision-making. 
      However, diagnosis-related documentation in the PICU is understudied, thus limiting 
      insights into how pediatric intensivists convey their diagnostic reasoning. Our 
      objective was to describe how pediatric critical care clinicians document patients' 
      diagnoses at PICU admission. DESIGN: Retrospective mixed methods study describing 
      diagnosis documentation in electronic health records. SETTING: Academic tertiary 
      referral PICU. PATIENTS: Children 0-17 years old admitted nonelectively to a single 
      PICU over 1 year. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred 
      PICU admission notes for 96 unique patients were reviewed. In 87% of notes, both 
      attending physicians and residents or advanced practice providers documented a 
      primary diagnosis; in 13%, primary diagnoses were documented by residents or 
      advanced practice providers alone. Most diagnoses (72%) were written as narrative 
      free text, 11% were documented as problem lists/billing codes, and 17% used both 
      formats. At least one rationale was documented to justify the primary diagnosis in 
      91% of notes. Diagnostic uncertainty was present in 52% of notes, most commonly 
      suggested by clinicians' use of words indicating uncertainty (65%) and documentation 
      of differential diagnoses (60%). Clinicians' integration and interpretation of 
      information varied in terms of: 1) organization of diagnosis narratives, 2) use of 
      contextual details to clarify the diagnosis, and 3) expression of diagnostic 
      uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: In this descriptive study, most PICU admission notes 
      documented a rationale for the primary diagnosis and expressed diagnostic 
      uncertainty. Clinicians varied widely in how they organized diagnostic information, 
      used contextual details to clarify the diagnosis, and expressed uncertainty. Future 
      work is needed to determine how diagnosis narratives affect clinical 
      decision-making, patient care, and outcomes.

TI  - Using Machine Learning to Capture Quality Metrics from Natural Language: A Case 
      Study of Diabetic Eye Exams.
PG  - 110-115
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1736311 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of value-based payment models has led to an 
      increased use of the electronic health record to capture quality measures, 
      necessitating additional documentation requirements for providers. METHODS: This 
      case study uses text mining and natural language processing techniques to identify 
      the timely completion of diabetic eye exams (DEEs) from 26,203 unique clinician 
      notes for reporting as an electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM). Logistic 
      regression and support vector machine (SVM) using unbalanced and balanced datasets, 
      using the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) algorithm, were 
      evaluated on precision, recall, sensitivity, and f1-score for classifying records 
      positive for DEE. We then integrate a high precision DEE model to evaluate free-text 
      clinical narratives from our clinical EHR system. RESULTS: Logistic regression and 
      SVM models had comparable f1-score and specificity metrics with models trained and 
      validated with no oversampling favoring precision over recall. SVM with and without 
      oversampling resulted in the best precision, 0.96, and recall, 0.85, respectively. 
      These two SVM models were applied to the unannotated 31,585 text segments 
      representing 24,823 unique records and 13,714 unique patients. The number of records 
      classified as positive for DEE using the SVM models ranged from 667 to 8,935 
      (2.7-36% out of 24,823, respectively). Unique patients classified as positive for 
      DEE ranged from 3.5 to 41.8% highlighting the potential utility of these models. 
      DISCUSSION: We believe the impact of oversampling on SVM model performance to be 
      caused by the potential of overfitting of the SVM SMOTE model on the synthesized 
      data and the data synthesis process. However, the specificities of SVM with and 
      without SMOTE were comparable, suggesting both models were confident in their 
      negative predictions. By prioritizing to implement the SVM model with higher 
      precision over sensitivity or recall in the categorization of DEEs, we can provide a 
      highly reliable pool of results that can be documented through automation, reducing 
      the burden of secondary review. Although the focus of this work was on completed 
      DEEs, this method could be applied to completing other necessary documentation by 
      extracting information from natural language in clinician notes. CONCLUSION: By 
      enabling the capture of data for eCQMs from documentation generated by usual 
      clinical practice, this work represents a case study in how such techniques can be 
      leveraged to drive quality without increasing clinician work.

TI  - Identification of Nonresponse to Treatment Using Narrative Data in an Electronic 
      Health Record Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort.
PG  - 151-8
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000580 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records, increasingly a part of healthcare, provide a 
      wealth of untapped narrative free text data that have the potential to accurately 
      inform clinical outcomes. METHODS: From a validated cohort of patients with Crohn's 
      disease or ulcerative colitis, we identified patients with ≥1 coded or narrative 
      mention of monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor α. Chart review by 
      ascertained true use of therapy, time of initiation, and cessation of treatment, and 
      also clinical response stratified as nonresponse, partial, or complete response at 1 
      year. Internal consistency was assessed in an independent validation cohort. 
      RESULTS: A total of 3087 patients had a mention of an antibodies to tumor necrosis 
      factor α. Actual therapy initiation was within 60 days of the first coded mention in 
      74% of patients. In the derivation cohort, 18% of antibodies to tumor necrosis 
      factor α starts were classified as nonresponse at 1 year, 21% as partial, and 56% as 
      complete response. On multivariate analysis, the number of narrative mentions of 
      diarrhea (odds ratio 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.14) and fatigue (odds 
      ratio 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.32) was independently associated with 
      nonresponse at 1 year (area under the curve 0.82). A likelihood of nonresponse score 
      comprising a weighted sum of both demonstrated a good dose-response relationship 
      across nonresponders (2.18), partial (1.20), and complete (0.50) responders (P < 
      0.0001) and correlated well with need for surgery or hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Narrative data in an electronic health record offer considerable potential to define 
      temporally evolving disease outcomes such as nonresponse to treatment.

      right on admission from ICD codes and demographic data.

LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103778 [doi]
AB  - Leveraging the Electronic Health Records (EHR) longitudinal data to produce 
      actionable clinical insights has always been a critical issue for recent studies. 
      Non-forecasted extended hospitalizations account for a disproportionate amount of 
      resource use, the mediocre quality of inpatient care, and avoidable fatalities. The 
      capability to predict the Length of Stay (LoS) and mortality in the early stages of 
      the admission provides opportunities to improve care and prevent many preventable 
      losses. Forecasting the in-hospital mortality is important in providing clinicians 
      with enough insights to make decisions and hospitals to allocate resources, hence 
      predicting the LoS and mortality within the first day of admission is a difficult 
      but a paramount endeavor. The biggest challenge is that few data are available by 
      this time, thus the prediction has to bring in the previous admissions history and 
      free text diagnosis that are recorded immediately on admission. We propose a model 
      that uses the multi-modal EHR structured medical codes and key demographic 
      information to classify the LoS in 3 classes; Short Los (LoS⩽10 days), Medium LoS 
      (10<LoS⩽30 days) and Long LoS (LoS>30 days) as well as mortality as a binary 
      classification of a patient's death during current admission. The prediction has to 
      use data available only within 24 h of admission. The key predictors include 
      previous ICD9 diagnosis codes, ICD9 procedures, key demographic data, and free text 
      diagnosis of the current admission recorded right on admission. We propose a 
      Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN-LoS and HAN-Mor) model and train it to a dataset 
      of over 45321 admissions recorded in the de-identified MIMIC-III dataset. For 
      improved prediction, our attention mechanisms can focus on the most influential past 
      admissions and most influential codes in these admissions. For fair performance 
      evaluation, we implemented and compared the HAN model with previous approaches. With 
      dataset balancing techniques HAN-LoS achieved an AUROC of over 0.82 and a Micro-F1 
      score of 0.24 and HAN-Mor achieved AUC-ROC of 0.87 hence outperforming the existing 
      baselines that use structured medical codes as well as clinical time series for LoS 
      and Mortality forecasting. By predicting mortality and LoS using the same model, we 
      show that with little tuning the proposed model can be used for other clinical 
      predictive tasks like phenotyping, decompensation,re-admission prediction, and 
      survival analysis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Clinical Care Classification (CCC) system is one of the standard 
      nursing terminologies recognized by the American Nurses Association, developed to 
      describe nursing care through electronic documentation in different healthcare 
      settings. The translation of the CCC system into languages other than English is 
      useful to promote its widespread use in different countries and to provide the 
      standard nursing data necessary for interoperable health information exchange. The 
      aim of this study was to translate the CCC system from English to Italian and to 
      test its clinical validity. METHODS: A translation with cross-cultural adaptation 
      was performed in four phases: forward-translation, back-translation, review, and 
      dissemination. Subsequently a pilot cross-mapping study between nursing activities 
      in free-text nursing documentation and the CCC interventions was conducted. RESULTS: 
      All elements of the CCC system were translated into Italian. Semantic and conceptual 
      equivalences were achieved. Altogether 77.8% of the nursing activities were mapped 
      into CCC interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The CCC system, and its integration into 
      electronic health records, has the potential to support Italian nurses in describing 
      and providing outcomes and costs of their care in different healthcare settings. 
      Future studies are needed to strengthen the impact of the CCC system on clinical

TI  - Characteristics of Finnish and Swedish intensive care nursing narratives: a 
      comparative analysis to support the development of clinical language technologies.
PG  - S1
LID - 10.1186/2041-1480-2-S3-S1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Free text is helpful for entering information into electronic health 
      records, but reusing it is a challenge. The need for language technology for 
      processing Finnish and Swedish healthcare text is therefore evident; however, 
      Finnish and Swedish are linguistically very dissimilar. In this paper we present a 
      comparison of characteristics in Finnish and Swedish free-text nursing narratives 
      from intensive care. This creates a framework for characterising and comparing 
      clinical text and lays the groundwork for developing clinical language technologies. 
      METHODS: Our material included daily nursing narratives from one intensive care unit 
      in Finland and one in Sweden. Inclusion criteria for patients were an inpatient 
      period of least five days and an age of at least 16 years. We performed a 
      comparative analysis as part of a collaborative effort between Finnish- and 
      Swedish-speaking healthcare and language technology professionals that included both 
      qualitative and quantitative aspects. The qualitative analysis addressed the content 
      and structure of three average-sized health records from each country. In the 
      quantitative analysis 514 Finnish and 379 Swedish health records were studied using 
      various language technology tools. RESULTS: Although the two languages are not 
      closely related, nursing narratives in Finland and Sweden had many properties in 
      common. Both made use of specialised jargon and their content was very similar. 
      However, many of these characteristics were challenging regarding development of 
      language technology to support producing and using clinical documentation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The way Finnish and Swedish intensive care nursing was documented, was 
      not country or language dependent, but shared a common context, principles and 
      structural features and even similar vocabulary elements. Technology solutions are 
      therefore likely to be applicable to a wider range of natural languages, but they 
      need linguistic tailoring. AVAILABILITY: The Finnish and Swedish data can be found

AB  - Clinical codes are used for public reporting purposes, are fundamental to 
      determining public financing for hospitals, and form the basis for reimbursement 
      claims to insurance providers. They are assigned to a patient stay to reflect the 
      diagnosis and performed procedures during that stay. This paper aims to enrich 
      algorithms for automated clinical coding by taking a data-driven approach and by 
      using unsupervised and semi-supervised techniques for the extraction of multi-word 
      expressions that convey a generalisable medical meaning (referred to as concepts). 
      Several methods for extracting concepts from text are compared, two of which are 
      constructed from a large unannotated corpus of clinical free text. A distributional 
      semantic model (i.c. the word2vec skip-gram model) is used to generalize over 
      concepts and retrieve relations between them. These methods are validated on three 
      sets of patient stay data, in the disease areas of urology, cardiology, and 
      gastroenterology. The datasets are in Dutch, which introduces a limitation on 
      available concept definitions from expert-based ontologies (e.g. UMLS). The results 
      show that when expert-based knowledge in ontologies is unavailable, concepts derived 
      from raw clinical texts are a reliable alternative. Both concepts derived from raw 
      clinical texts perform and concepts derived from expert-created dictionaries 
      outperform a bag-of-words approach in clinical code assignment. Adding features 
      based on tokens that appear in a semantically similar context has a positive 
      influence for predicting diagnostic codes. Furthermore, the experiments indicate 
      that a distributional semantics model can find relations between semantically 
      related concepts in texts but also introduces erroneous and redundant relations, 
      which can undermine clinical coding performance.

AB  - Clinical data are dynamic in nature, often arranged hierarchically and stored as 
      free text and numbers. Effective management of clinical data and the transformation 
      of the data into structured format for data analysis are therefore challenging 
      issues in electronic health records development. Despite the popularity of 
      relational databases, the scalability of the NoSQL database model and the 
      document-centric data structure of XML databases appear to be promising features for 
      effective clinical data management. In this paper, three database approaches--NoSQL, 
      XML-enabled and native XML--are investigated to evaluate their suitability for 
      structured clinical data. The database query performance is reported, together with 
      our experience in the databases development. The results show that NoSQL database is 
      the best choice for query speed, whereas XML databases are advantageous in terms of 
      scalability, flexibility and extensibility, which are essential to cope with the 
      characteristics of clinical data. While NoSQL and XML technologies are relatively 
      new compared to the conventional relational database, both of them demonstrate 
      potential to become a key database technology for clinical data management as the 
      technology further advances.

TI  - Potentially inappropriate medications and their effect on falls during hospital 
      admission.
LID - afab205 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afab205 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to investigate the effect of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) 
      on inpatient falls and to identify whether PIMs as defined by STOPPFall or the 
      designated section K for falls of STOPP v2 have a stronger association with 
      inpatient falls when compared to the general tool STOPP v2. METHODS: a retrospective 
      observational matching study using an electronic health records dataset of patients 
      (≥70 years) admitted to an academic hospital (2015-19), including free text to 
      identify inpatient falls. PIMs were identified using the STOPP v2, section K of 
      STOPP v2 and STOPPFall. We first matched admissions with PIMs to those without PIMs 
      on confounding factors. We then applied multinomial logistic regression analysis and 
      Cox proportional hazards analysis on the matched datasets to identify effects of 
      PIMs on inpatient falls. RESULTS: the dataset included 16,678 hospital admissions, 
      with a mean age of 77.2 years. Inpatient falls occurred during 446 (2.7%) 
      admissions. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) for the 
      association between PIM exposure and falls were 7.9 (6.1-10.3) for STOPP section K, 
      2.2 (2.0-2.5) for STOPP and 1.4 (1.3-1.5) for STOPPFall. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 
      (95% CI) for the effect on time to first fall were 2.8 (2.3-3.5) for STOPP section 
      K, 1.5 (1.3-1.6) for STOPP and 1.3 (1.2-1.5) for STOPPFall. CONCLUSIONS: we 
      identified an independent association of PIMs on inpatient falls for all applied 
      (de)prescribing tools. The strongest effect was identified for STOPP section K, 
      which is restricted to high-risk medication for falls. Our results suggest that 
      decreasing PIM exposure during hospital stay might benefit fall prevention, but 
      intervention studies are warranted.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI190226 [doi]
AB  - Predicting the risk of mortality for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
      using electronic health records (EHRs) data can help identify risky patients who 
      might need more tailored care. In our previous work, we built computational models 
      to predict one-year mortality of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) 
      with AMI or post myocardial infarction syndrome. Our prior work only used the 
      structured clinical data from MIMIC-III, a publicly available ICU clinical database. 
      In this study, we enhanced our work by adding the word embedding features from 
      free-text discharge summaries. Using a richer set of features resulted in 
      significant improvement in the performance of our deep learning models. The average 
      accuracy of our deep learning models was 92.89% and the average F-measure was 0.928. 
      We further reported the impact of different combinations of features extracted from 
      structured and/or unstructured data on the performance of the deep learning models.

TI  - Filmed Monologue Vignettes: a novel method for investigating how clinicians document 
      consultations in electronic health records.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The accuracy of conclusions from research based on 
      Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) is highly dependent on the correct selection of 
      descriptors (codes) by users, but few methods exist for examining quality and 
      drivers of documentation. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of 
      filmed vignette monologues as a resource-light method of assessing and comparing how 
      different EHR users record the same clinical scenario. METHODS: Six short monologues 
      portraying simulated patients presenting allergic conditions to their General 
      Practitioners were filmed head-on then electronically distributed for the study; no 
      researcher was present during data collection. The method was assessed by 
      participant uptake, reported ease of completion by participants, compliance with 
      instructions, the receipt of interpretable data by researchers, and participant 
      perceptions of vignette quality, realism and information content. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-two participants completed the study, reporting only minor difficulties. 132 
      screenshots were returned electronically, enabling analysis of codes, free text and 
      EHR features. Participants assigned a quality rating of 7.7/10 (range 2-10) to the 
      vignettes and rated the extent to which vignettes reflected real-life at 93% (range 
      86-100%). Between 1 and 2 hours were required to complete the task. Full compliance 
      with instructions varied between participants, but was largely successful. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Filmed monologues are a reproducible, standardized method, which 
      require relatively few resources, yet allow clear assessment of clinicians' and EHRs 
      systems' impact on documentation. The novel nature of this method necessitates clear 
      instructions, so participants can fully complete the study without face-to-face 
      researcher supervision.

TI  - New Paradigms for Patient-Centered Outcomes Research in Electronic Medical Records: 
      An Example of Detecting Urinary Incontinence Following Prostatectomy.
PG  - 1231

LID - 1231
AB  - INTRODUCTION: National initiatives to develop quality metrics emphasize the need to 
      include patient-centered outcomes. Patient-centered outcomes are complex, require 
      documentation of patient communications, and have not been routinely collected by 
      healthcare providers. The widespread implementation of electronic medical records 
      (EHR) offers opportunities to assess patient-centered outcomes within the routine 
      healthcare delivery system. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility 
      and accuracy of identifying patient centered outcomes within the EHR. METHODS: Data 
      from patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing prostatectomy were used to 
      develop and test algorithms to accurately identify patient-centered outcomes in 
      post-operative EHRs - we used urinary incontinence as the use case. Standard data 
      mining techniques were used to extract and annotate free text and structured data to 
      assess urinary incontinence recorded within the EHRs. RESULTS: A total 5,349 
      prostate cancer patients were identified in our EHR-system between 1998-2013. Among 
      these EHRs, 30.3% had a text mention of urinary incontinence within 90 days 
      post-operative compared to less than 1.0% with a structured data field for urinary 
      incontinence (i.e. ICD-9 code). Our workflow had good precision and recall for 
      urinary incontinence (positive predictive value: 0.73 and sensitivity: 0.84). 
      DISCUSSION: Our data indicate that important patient-centered outcomes, such as 
      urinary incontinence, are being captured in EHRs as free text and highlight the 
      long-standing importance of accurate clinician documentation. Standard data mining 
      algorithms can accurately and efficiently identify these outcomes in existing EHRs; 
      the complete assessment of these outcomes is essential to move practice into the 
      patient-centered realm of healthcare.

PG  - 175-85
LID - 10.4338/ACI-2012-02-CR-0003 [doi]
AB  - Electronic physician documentation is an essential element of a complete electronic 
      medical record (EMR). At Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, a teaching hospital 
      affiliated with Stanford University, we implemented an inpatient electronic 
      documentation system for physicians over a 12-month period. Using an EMR-based 
      free-text editor coupled with automated import of system data elements, we were able 
      to achieve voluntary, widespread adoption of the electronic documentation process. 
      When given the choice between electronic versus dictated report creation, the vast 
      majority of users preferred the electronic method. In addition to increasing the 
      legibility and accessibility of clinical notes, we also decreased the volume of 
      dictated notes and scanning of handwritten notes, which provides the opportunity for 
      cost savings to the institution.

TI  - Use of emergency department electronic medical records for automated epidemiological 
      surveillance of suicide attempts: a French pilot study.
LID - 10.1002/mpr.1522 [doi]
LID - e1522
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether an expert system based on automated 
      processing of electronic health records (EHRs) could provide a more accurate 
      estimate of the annual rate of emergency department (ED) visits for suicide attempts 
      in France, as compared to the current national surveillance system based on manual 
      coding by emergency practitioners. A feasibility study was conducted at Lyon 
      University Hospital, using data for all ED patient visits in 2012. After automatic 
      data extraction and pre-processing, including automatic coding of medical free-text 
      through use of the Unified Medical Language System, seven different machine-learning 
      methods were used to classify the reasons for ED visits into "suicide attempts" 
      versus "other reasons". The performance of these different methods was compared by 
      using the F-measure. In a test sample of 444 patients admitted to the ED in 2012 (98 
      suicide attempts, 48 cases of suicidal ideation, and 292 controls with no recorded 
      non-fatal suicidal behaviour), the F-measure for automatic detection of suicide 
      attempts ranged from 70.4% to 95.3%. The random forest and naïve Bayes methods 
      performed best. This study demonstrates that machine-learning methods can improve 
      the quality of epidemiological indicators as compared to current national 
      surveillance of suicide attempts.

TI  - A Framework for Systematic Assessment of Clinical Trial Population 
      Representativeness Using Electronic Health Records Data.
PG  - 816-825
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1733846 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical trials are the gold standard for generating robust medical 
      evidence, but clinical trial results often raise generalizability concerns, which 
      can be attributed to the lack of population representativeness. The electronic 
      health records (EHRs) data are useful for estimating the population 
      representativeness of clinical trial study population. OBJECTIVES: This research 
      aims to estimate the population representativeness of clinical trials systematically 
      using EHR data during the early design stage. METHODS: We present an end-to-end 
      analytical framework for transforming free-text clinical trial eligibility criteria 
      into executable database queries conformant with the Observational Medical Outcomes 
      Partnership Common Data Model and for systematically quantifying the population 
      representativeness for each clinical trial. RESULTS: We calculated the population 
      representativeness of 782 novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) trials and 3,827 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) trials in the United States respectively using this 
      framework. With the use of overly restrictive eligibility criteria, 85.7% of the 
      COVID-19 trials and 30.1% of T2DM trials had poor population representativeness. 
      CONCLUSION: This research demonstrates the potential of using the EHR data to assess 
      the clinical trials population representativeness, providing data-driven metrics to 
      inform the selection and optimization of eligibility criteria.

TI  - Tomorrow's transcription tools: what new technology means for healthcare.
PG  - 39-43; quiz 45-6
AB  - The year is 2006, and there are just a few hundred medical transcriptionists (MTs) 
      still transcribing reports, serving only those older physicians who haven't changed 
      with the times--and the times have definitely changed. Physicians have finally 
      recognized the power of electronic health records (EHRs) as well as the fact that 
      this power is realized only if they input clinical data directly into the EHR. The 
      vast majority of physicians are using empirically refined templates, pick lists, and 
      other methods of structured, codified input through the evolved progeny of today's 
      Palm PCs, Pocket PCs, and Tablet PCs. Input methods include touch-screen, speech 
      recognition, handwriting recognition, and perhaps other technology not yet invented. 
      There are no longer any delays or expenses resulting from transcription. Plus 
      healthcare organizations enjoy numerous benefits derived from analyzing codified 
      clinical data. But this is only one vision. Another vision of 2006 incorporates an 
      unavoidable reality: many physicians strongly resist directly inputting clinical 
      data. They believe it slows them down, which outweighs the potentials overall 
      healthcare benefits. Additionally, these physicians believe that structured input of 
      patient information limits the freedom of expression afforded by free text. And 
      frankly, these physicians don't put much stock in the value of clinical practive 
      analysis. So transcription continues. In fact, it expands dramatically. Due to 
      regulatory controls and other pressures, more providers dictate more clinical notes 
      than ever. The need for MTs explodes. In 2006, there are half a million MTs required 
      to convert voice dictations into text, more than double today's number.

TI  - Systemic Corticosteroids in Patients with Bronchial Asthma: A Real-Life Study.
PG  - 0
LID - 10.18176/jiaci.0765 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to determine the use of systemic 
      corti-costeroids (SCs) in patients with bronchial asthma using big data analysis. 
      METHODS: We performed an observational, retrospective, noninterventional study based 
      on secondary data captured from free text in the electronic health records. This 
      study was per-formed based on data from the regional health service of Castille-La 
      Mancha (SESCAM), Spain. We performed the analysis using big data and artificial 
      intelligence via Savana® Manager version 3.0. RESULTS: During the study period, 103 
      667 patients were diagnosed with and treated for asthma at different care levels. 
      The search was restricted to patients aged 10 to 90 years (mean age, 43.5 [95%CI, 
      43.4-43.7] years). Of these, 59.8% were women. SCs were taken for treatment of 
      asthma by 58 745 patients at some point during the study period. These patients were 
      older, with a higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, ob-esity, 
      depression, and hiatus hernia. SCs are used frequently in the general population 
      with asthma (31.4% in 2015 and 39.6% in 2019). SCs were prescribed mainly in primary 
      care (59%), allergy (13%) and pulmonology (20%). The frequency of prescription of 
      SCs had a direct impact on the main associated adverse effects. CONCLUSION: In 
      clinical practice, SCs are frequently prescribed to patients with asthma, especially 
      in primary care. Use of SCs is associated with a greater number of adverse events. 
      It is necessary to implement measures to reduce prescription of SCs to patients with 
      asthma, especially in primary care.

TI  - Childhood sexual abuse in patients with severe mental Illness: Demographic, clinical 
      and functional correlates.
PG  - 495-502
LID - 10.1111/acps.13302 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use data from electronic health records (EHRs) to describe the 
      demographic, clinical and functional correlates of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) in 
      patients with severe mental illness (SMI), and compare their clinical outcomes 
      (admissions and receipt of antipsychotic medications) to those of patients with no 
      recorded history of CSA. METHODS: We applied a string-matching technique to clinical 
      text records of 7000 patients with SMI (non-organic psychotic disorders or bipolar 
      disorder), identifying 619 (8.8%) patients with a recorded history of CSA. Data were 
      extracted from both free-text and structured fields of patients' EHRs. RESULTS: 
      Comorbid diagnoses of major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and 
      personality disorders were more prevalent in patients with CSA. Positive psychotic 
      symptoms, depressed mood, self-harm, substance use and aggression were also more 
      prevalent in this group, as were problems with relationships and living conditions. 
      The odds of inpatient admissions were higher in patients with CSA than in those 
      without (adjusted OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.64-2.33), and they were more likely to have 
      spent more than 10 days per year as inpatients (adjusted OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 
      1.07-1.62). Patients with CSA were more likely to be prescribed antipsychotic 
      medications (adjusted OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.69-3.66) and be given over 75% of the 
      maximum recommended daily dose (adjusted OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.44-2.04). CONCLUSION: 
      Data-driven approaches are a reliable, promising avenue for research on childhood 
      trauma. Clinicians should be trained and skilled at identifying childhood adversity 
      in patients with SMI, and addressing it as part of the care plan.

TI  - Elderly Surgical Patients: Automated Computation of Healthcare Quality Indicators by 
      Data Reuse of EHR.
PG  - 92-6
AB  - The objective of the work is to implement and evaluate the automated computation of 
      9 healthcare quality indicators, by data reuse of electronic health records, in the 
      field of elderly surgical patients. METHODS: Data are extracted from EHR, including 
      administrative data, ICD10 diagnoses, laboratory results, procedures, administered 
      drugs, and free-text letters. The indicators are implemented by a medical data reuse 
      specialist. The conformity rate is automatically computed (3.5 minutes for 15,000 
      inpatient stays and 9 indicators). A medical expert reviews 45 stays per indicator. 
      The precision is the proportion of non-conform inpatient stays among the cases 
      detected as non-conform by the algorithms. RESULTS: the paper describes the 
      implemented algorithms, the conformity rates and the precisions. Two indicators have 
      a precision of 0%, 3 indicators have a precision of 40 to 60%, and four indicators 
      have a precision from 80 to 100% (for 2 of them, the conformity rate is lower than 
      2.5%!). This demonstrates that automated quality screening is possible and enables 
      to detect threatening situations. The implementation of the indicators requires 
      special skills in medicine, medical information sciences, and algorithmics. Failures 
      of precision are mainly due to defaults of information quality (missing codes), and 
      could benefit from text analysis.

TI  - Design and evaluation of a semantic approach for the homogeneous identification of 
      events in eight patient databases: a contribution to the European EU-ADR project.
PG  - 1085-9
AB  - The overall objective of the EU-ADR project is the design, development, and 
      validation of a computerised system that exploits data from electronic health 
      records and biomedical databases for the early detection of adverse drug reactions. 
      Eight different databases, containing health records of more than 30 million 
      European citizens, are involved in the project. Unique queries cannot be performed 
      across different databases because of their heterogeneity: Medical record and Claims 
      databases, four different terminologies for coding diagnoses, and two languages for 
      the information described in free text. The aim of our study was to provide database 
      owners with a common basis for the construction of their queries. Using the UMLS, we 
      provided a list of medical concepts, with their corresponding terms and codes in the 
      four terminologies, which should be considered to retrieve the relevant information 
      for the events of interest from the databases.

TI  - Optimized Computerized Order Entry can Reduce Errors in Electronic Prescriptions and 
      Associated Pharmacy Calls to Clarify (CTC).
PG  - 587-95
LID - 10.4338/ACI-2015-10-RA-0140 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After implementation of a system-wide EMR within our university system, 
      e-prescribing is now commonplace. OBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a study to assess 
      whether optimization of computerized provider order entry (CPOE) can reduce errors 
      in these electronically transmitted prescriptions and would require less frequent 
      interventions from pharmacists, in particular the need for them to "call to clarify" 
      (CTC) details of particular prescriptions. Secondary analysis based on cost 
      assumptions was preformed to presume cost differences before and after optimization 
      changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to generate complete, error-free 
      prescriptions, optimization changes were implemented in the form of in line 
      validation messages. These messages were generated if (1) an order did not specify a 
      provider or pharmacy; (2) the DEA requirements were not met; (3) character limits 
      were exceeded in patient sig or demographics or (4) administration instructions had 
      breaks or had both discrete and free text elements. Retrospectively, prescriptions 
      were randomly selected from a nine month period before and after implementing 
      changes. These prescriptions were analyzed by a pharmacist and a nurse to identify 
      types of errors that would require a CTC to a prescribing provider. Errors were 
      compared statistically to determine effectiveness of changes pre and post 
      optimization. RESULTS: A total of 602 prescriptions were analyzed; 301 before 
      changes and 301 after changes. Of these prescriptions, 20.27% had errors before 
      changes and 12.96% had errors after changes. The decline in the error rate was 
      considered statistically significant for p<0.05. The cost savings were estimated at 
      $76 per 100 prescriptions for pharmacist and physician time-cost estimates combined. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Implementing optimization changes to the CPOE resulted in a reduction 
      in error rate requiring pharmacist CTC. This study identifies effective optimization 
      changes for electronic prescribing that can reduce prescribing errors and may result 
      in cost saving.

TI  - A strategy for assessment and validation of major bleeding cases in a primary health 
      care database in Spain.
PG  - 1696-1702
LID - 10.1002/pds.5357 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to validate major bleeding (MB) cases within a cohort of 
      new users of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in Electronic health records (EHRs) 
      from primary care in Spain (BIFAP), introducing more efficient techniques and 
      automating the process of validation in the pharmacoepidemiologic research with EHR 
      data as much as possible. METHODS: Registered bleedings were identified in a cohort 
      of new users of DOACs in BIFAP using ICPC 2 and ICD 9 codes; we ascertained these 
      bleedings as MB through a validation strategy based on the MB definition from the 
      International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis, which used hospitalization and 
      critical localization as proxies. We assessed hospitalization with hospital 
      discharge information (only available for some years and regions) and a free 
      text-based algorithm created to identify hospitalization in EHR's clinical notes. 
      Incidence rates (IR) of MB were evaluated by bleeding type. RESULTS: The study 
      cohort included 104 614 patients, with 274521.5 p-y of follow up. There were 6143 
      registered bleedings during the study period (519 intracranial bleeding - ICB, 4606 
      gastrointestinal bleeding - GIB, 1018 extracranial bleeding - ECB), from which 1679 
      were confirmed as MB (416 ICB, 1086 GIB, and 177 ECB). The free text-based 
      semi-automatic algorithm had moderate recall (0.59), but high specificity (0.99), 
      and precision (0.94). CONCLUSION: The combination of hospitalization and critical 
      localization is a valid approach to validate MB in EHRs with incomplete information. 
      The use of more automatic methods for case validation instead of manual review of 
      clinical notes is favored.

TI  - Early Intervention Referral Information, Transmission, and Sources-A Survey of State 
      Part C Coordinators and Analysis of Referral Forms.
LID - 10.1097/DBP.0000000000001004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Early Intervention (EI) referral is a key connector between health care 
      and early childhood systems serving children with developmental risks. This study 
      aimed to describe the US network of EI referrals by answering the following: "What 
      information is sent to EI?", "Who sends it?", and "How is it sent?" METHOD: This 
      study combined an analysis of national document-based and website-based referral 
      forms with a survey of state Part C Coordinators (PCCs). Data on referral forms were 
      systematically collected from state agency websites. PCCs from 52 jurisdictions were 
      surveyed to assess current EI referral practices. Descriptive statistics were used 
      for responses to multiple-choice items; free-text answers were condensed into key 
      study themes. RESULTS: EI referral forms came as e-documents (81%) or websites 
      (35%), and 72% were in English alone. They emphasized family and referral source 
      contact information and reason for the referral. The survey results indicated that 
      health care (45%) sends the most referrals, followed by families (30%). EI agencies 
      received referrals by phone (38%), electronically (23%), e-mail (17%), and fax 
      (17%), and PCCs valued this diversity of methods. Few states received referral data 
      directly from electronic health records (EHRs); however, PCCs hope to eventually 
      receive referrals through websites, mobile devices, and EHRs. CONCLUSION: EI 
      referral data flow is complex, with opportunities for loss of children to follow-up. 
      This study describes how EI referrals occur and provides examples of how 
      communication and access to information may be improved.

LID - 10.1016/j.annepidem.2020.09.013 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: HIV research among transgender and gender nonbinary (TGNB) people is 
      limited by lack of gender identity data collection. We designed an EHR-based 
      algorithm to identify TGNB people among people living with HIV (PLWH) when gender 
      identity was not systematically collected. METHODS: We applied EHR-based search 
      criteria to all PLWH receiving care at a large urban health system between 1997 and 
      2017, then confirmed gender identity by chart review. We compared patient 
      characteristics by gender identity and screening criteria, then calculated positive 
      predictive values for each criterion. RESULTS: Among 18,086 PLWH, 213 (1.2%) met 
      criteria as potential TGNB patients and 178/213 were confirmed. Positive predictive 
      values were highest for free-text keywords (91.7%) and diagnosis codes (77.4%). 
      Confirmed TGNB patients were younger (median 32.5 vs. 42.5 years, P < .001) and less 
      likely to be Hispanic (37.1% vs. 62.9%, P = .03) than unconfirmed patients. Among 
      confirmed patients, 15% met criteria only for prospective gender identity data 
      collection and were significantly older. CONCLUSION: EHR-based criteria can identify 
      TGNB PLWH, but success may differ by ethnicity and age. Retrospective versus 
      intentional, prospective gender identity data collection may capture different 
      patients. To reduce misclassification in epidemiologic studies, gender identity data 
      collection should address these potential differences and be systematic and 
      prospective.

TI  - Frequency analysis of medical concepts in clinical trials and their coverage in MeSH 
      and SNOMED-CT.
PG  - 83-92
LID - 10.3414/ME14-01-0046 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eligibility criteria (EC) of clinical trials play a key role in 
      selecting appropriate study candidates and the validity of the outcome of a clinical 
      trial. However, in most cases EC are provided in unstandardised ways such as free 
      text, which raises significant challenges for machine-readability. OBJECTIVES: To 
      establish a list of most frequent medical concepts in clinical trials with semantic 
      annotations. This concept list contributes to standardisation of EC and identifies 
      relevant data items in electronic health records (EHRs) for clinical research. The 
      coverage of the list in two major clinical vocabularies, MeSH and SNOMED-CT, will be 
      assessed. METHODS: Four hundred and twenty-five clinical trials conducted between 
      2000 and 2011 at a German university hospital were analysed. 6671 EC were manually 
      annotated by a medical coder using Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) provided by the 
      Unified Medical Language System. Two physicians performed a semi-automatic CUI code 
      revision. Concept frequency was analysed and clusters of concepts were manually 
      identified.A binomial significance test was applied to quantify coverage differences 
      of the most frequent concepts in MeSH and SNOMED-CT. RESULTS: Based on manual 
      medical coding of 425 clinical trials, 7588 concepts were identified, of which 5236 
      were distinct. A top 100 list containing 101 most frequent medical concepts was 
      established. The concepts of this list cover 25 % of all concept occurrences in all 
      analysed clinical trials. This list reveals six missing entries in SNOMED-CT, 12 in 
      MeSH. The median of EC frequency per trial has increased throughout the trial years 
      (2000 -2005: 8 EC/trial, 2011: 14 EC/trial). CONCLUSIONS: Relatively few concepts 
      cover one quarter of concept occurrences that represent EC in recent studies. 
      Therefore, these concepts can serve as candidate data elements for integration into 
      EHRs to optimise patient recruitment in clinical research.

TI  - A Framework for Leveraging "Big Data" to Advance Epidemiology and Improve Quality: 
      Design of the VA Colonoscopy Collaborative.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.5334/egems.198 [doi]
LID - 4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a framework for leveraging big data for research and quality 
      improvement purposes and demonstrate implementation of the framework for design of 
      the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Colonoscopy Collaborative. METHODS: We 
      propose that research utilizing large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) can be 
      approached in a 4 step framework: 1) Identify data sources required to answer 
      research question; 2) Determine whether variables are available as structured or 
      free-text data; 3) Utilize a rigorous approach to refine variables and assess data 
      quality; 4) Create the analytic dataset and perform analyses. We describe 
      implementation of the framework as part of the VA Colonoscopy Collaborative, which 
      aims to leverage big data to 1) prospectively measure and report colonoscopy quality 
      and 2) develop and validate a risk prediction model for colorectal cancer (CRC) and 
      high-risk polyps. RESULTS: Examples of implementation of the 4 step framework are 
      provided. To date, we have identified 2,337,171 Veterans who have undergone 
      colonoscopy between 1999 and 2014. Median age was 62 years, and 4.6 percent (n = 
      106,860) were female. We estimated that 2.6 percent (n = 60,517) had CRC diagnosed 
      at baseline. An additional 1 percent (n = 24,483) had a new ICD-9 code-based 
      diagnosis of CRC on follow up. CONCLUSION: We hope our framework may contribute to 
      the dialogue on best practices to ensure high quality epidemiologic and quality 
      improvement work. As a result of implementation of the framework, the VA Colonoscopy 
      Collaborative holds great promise for 1) quantifying and providing novel 
      understandings of colonoscopy outcomes, and 2) building a robust approach for 
      nationwide VA colonoscopy quality reporting.

AB  - Clinical laboratory results are stored in electronic health records (EHRs) as 
      structured data coded with local or standard terms. However, laboratory tests that 
      are performed at outside laboratories are often simply labeled "outside test" or 
      something similar, with the actual test name in a free-text result or comment field. 
      After being aggregated into clinical data repositories, these ambiguous labels 
      impede the retrieval of specific test results. We present a general multi-step 
      solution that can facilitate the identification, standardization, reconciliation, 
      and transformation of such test results. We applied our approach to data in the NIH 
      Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS) to identify laboratory 
      tests, map comment values to the LOINC codes that will be incorporated into our 
      Research Entities Dictionary (RED), and develop a reference table that can be used 
      in the EHR data extract-transform-load (ETL) process.

TI  - Meaningful measurement: developing a measurement system to improve blood pressure 
      control in patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - e97-e101
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001308 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop an electronic registry of patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) treated in a nephrology practice in order to provide clinically 
      meaningful measurement and population management to improve rates of blood pressure 
      (BP) control. METHODS: We combined data from multiple electronic sources: the 
      billing system, structured fields in the electronic health record (EHR), and free 
      text physician notes using natural language processing (NLP). We also used 
      point-of-care worksheets to capture clinical rationale. RESULTS: Nephrologist 
      billing accurately identified patients with CKD. Using an algorithm that 
      incorporated multiple BP readings increased the measured rate of control (130/80 mm 
      Hg) from 37.1% to 42.3%. With the addition of NLP to capture BP readings from free 
      text notes, the rate was 52.6%. Data from point-of-care worksheets indicated that in 
      52% of visits in which patients were identified as not having controlled BP, 
      patients were actually at goal based on BP readings taken at home or on that day in 
      the office. CONCLUSIONS: Building a method for clinically meaningful continuous 
      performance measurement of BP control is possible, but will require data from 
      multiple sources. Electronic measurement systems need to grow to be able to capture 
      and process performance data from patients as well as in real-time from physicians.

TI  - A semantic approach for the homogeneous identification of events in eight patient 
      databases: a contribution to the European eu-ADR project.
PG  - 190-4
AB  - The overall objective of the eu-ADR project is the design, development, and 
      validation of a computerised system that exploits data from electronic health 
      records and biomedical databases for the early detection of adverse drug reactions. 
      Eight different databases, containing health records of more than 30 million 
      European citizens, are involved in the project. Unique queries cannot be performed 
      across different databases because of their heterogeneity: Medical record and Claims 
      databases, four different terminologies for coding diagnoses, and two languages for 
      the information described in free text. The aim of our study was to provide database 
      owners with a common basis for the construction of their queries. Using the UMLS, we 
      provided a list of medical concepts, with their corresponding terms and codes in the 
      four terminologies, which should be considered to retrieve the relevant information 
      for the events of interest from the databases.

TI  - Leveraging the EHR4CR platform to support patient inclusion in academic studies: 
      challenges and lessons learned.
PG  - 36
LID - 10.1186/s12874-017-0299-3 [doi]
LID - 36
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in hospitals offers 
      the ability to reuse data from patient care activities for clinical research. EHR4CR 
      is a European public-private partnership aiming to develop a computerized platform 
      that enables the re-use of data collected from EHRs over its network. However, the 
      reproducibility of queries may depend on attributes of the local data. Our objective 
      was 1/ to describe the different steps that were achieved in order to use the EHR4CR 
      platform and 2/ to identify the specific issues that could impact the final 
      performance of the platform. METHODS: We selected three institutional studies 
      covering various medical domains. The studies included a total of 67 inclusion and 
      exclusion criteria and ran in two University Hospitals. We described the steps 
      required to use the EHR4CR platform for a feasibility study. We also defined metrics 
      to assess each of the steps (including criteria complexity, normalization quality, 
      and data completeness of EHRs). RESULTS: We identified 114 distinct medical concepts 
      from a total of 67 eligibility criteria Among the 114 concepts: 23 (20.2%) 
      corresponded to non-structured data (i.e. for which transformation is needed before 
      analysis), 92 (81%) could be mapped to terminologies used in EHR4CR, and 86 (75%) 
      could be mapped to local terminologies. We identified 51 computable criteria 
      following the normalization process. The normalization was considered by experts to 
      be satisfactory or higher for 64.2% (43/67) of the computable criteria. All of the 
      computable criteria could be expressed using the EHR4CR platform. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      identified a set of issues that could affect the future results of the platform: (a) 
      the normalization of free-text criteria, (b) the translation into computer-friendly 
      criteria and (c) issues related to the execution of the query to clinical data 
      warehouses. We developed and evaluated metrics to better describe the platforms and 
      their result. These metrics could be used for future reports of Clinical Trial 
      Recruitment Support Systems assessment studies, and provide experts and readers with 
      tools to insure the quality of constructed dataset.

TI  - How to Develop and Implement a Computerized Decision Support System Integrated for 
      Antimicrobial Stewardship? Experiences From Two Swiss Hospital Systems.
PG  - 583390
LID - 10.3389/fdgth.2020.583390 [doi]
LID - 583390
AB  - Background: Computerized decision support systems (CDSS) provide new opportunities 
      for automating antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions and integrating them in 
      routine healthcare. CDSS are recommended as part of AMS programs by international 
      guidelines but few have been implemented so far. In the context of the publicly 
      funded COMPuterized Antibiotic Stewardship Study (COMPASS), we developed and 
      implemented two CDSSs for antimicrobial prescriptions integrated into the in-house 
      electronic health records of two public hospitals in Switzerland. Developing and 
      implementing such systems was a unique opportunity for learning during which we 
      faced several challenges. In this narrative review we describe key lessons learned. 
      Recommendations: (1) During the initial planning and development stage, start by 
      drafting the CDSS as an algorithm and use a standardized format to communicate 
      clearly the desired functionalities of the tool to all stakeholders. (2) Set up a 
      multidisciplinary team bringing together Information Technologies (IT) specialists 
      with development expertise, clinicians familiar with "real-life" processes in the 
      wards and if possible, involve collaborators having knowledge in both areas. (3) 
      When designing the CDSS, make the underlying decision-making process transparent for 
      physicians and start simple and make sure to find the right balance between force 
      and persuasion to ensure adoption by end-users. (4) Correctly assess the clinical 
      and economic impact of your tool, therefore try to use standardized terminologies 
      and limit the use of free text for analysis purpose. (5) At the implementation 
      stage, plan usability testing early, develop an appropriate training plan suitable 
      to end users' skills and time-constraints and think ahead of additional challenges 
      related to the study design that may occur (such as a cluster randomized trial). 
      Stay also tuned to react quickly during the intervention phase. (6) Finally, during 
      the assessment stage plan ahead maintenance, adaptation and related financial 
      challenges and stay connected with institutional partners to leverage potential 
      synergies with other informatics projects.

AB  - The introduction of Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) has been shown to 
      reduce the incidence of medication-related errors in hospitals. Successful 
      implementation of CPOE and electronic health records requires redesigning workflows 
      and analysis of information collected and training of staff to use these new 
      systems. However, well intentioned processes that seem to solve a unique problem can 
      sometimes go in an unanticipated direction for several reasons. This can have 
      unintentional consequences, especially when the built-in safeguards are not engaged. 
      This poster describes one organization's efforts to identify the causes of one such 
      breakdown, and how the obvious solutions were inappropriate.

TI  - Value of a genetics clinic evaluation in identifying women at risk for hereditary 
      breast-ovarian cancer syndrome.
LID - 10.1002/jgc4.1425 [doi]
AB  - Our work evaluates the contributions of a genetics clinic visit in assessing 
      patients' risk of hereditary cancers and in meeting National Cancer Comprehensive 
      Network (NCCN) criteria for genetic testing. We reviewed the electronic health 
      records (EHR) of 56 women seen for medical care in our healthcare system who were 
      subsequently seen in the Adult Genetics Clinic. We searched for all personal or 
      family cancer history available in either free-text or structured form within the 
      EHR prior to the genetics visit. For each patient, we then compared the aggregate 
      data with the pedigree information obtained at the Genetics Clinic visit for first-, 
      second-, and third-degree relatives. During the genetics clinic visit, the number of 
      relatives with cancer diagnoses doubled from 121 to 235, and for 17 of 56 (30%) of 
      patients, family histories changed one or more NCCN criteria. For 39/56 (70%) of 
      patients, the family history in the EHR was not changed during the genetics clinic 
      visit. Of 56 women referred to the genetics clinic, 45 (80%) met NCCN guidelines for 
      testing, 40 women underwent genetic testing, and 9 of 40 (23%) tested were positive 
      for a Likely Pathogenic or Pathogenic (LP/P) variant. This study of 56 women 
      quantitatively demonstrates the value of a genetics clinic visit by improved 
      identification of key family history components.

TI  - The use of narrative electronic prescribing instructions in pharmacoepidemiology: A 
      scoping review for the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology.
PG  - 1281-1292
LID - 10.1002/pds.5331 [doi]
AB  - Narrative electronic prescribing instructions (NEPIs) are text that convey 
      information on the administration or co-administration of a drug as directed by a 
      prescriber. For researchers, NEPIs have the potential to advance our understanding 
      of the risks and benefits of medications in populations; however, due to their 
      unstructured nature, they are not often utilized. The goal of this scoping review 
      was to evaluate how NEPIs are currently employed in research, identify opportunities 
      and challenges for their broader application, and provide recommendations on their 
      future use. The scoping review comprised a comprehensive literature review and a 
      survey of key stakeholders. From the literature review, we identified 33 primary 
      articles that described the use of NEPIs. The majority of articles (n = 19) 
      identified issues with the quality of information in NEPIs compared with structured 
      prescribing information; nine articles described the development of novel algorithms 
      that performed well in extracting information from NEPIs, and five described the 
      used of manual or simpler algorithms to extract prescribing information from NEPIs. 
      A survey of 19 stakeholders indicated concerns for the quality of information in 
      NEPIs and called for standardization of NEPIs to reduce data variability/errors. 
      Nevertheless, stakeholders believed NEPIs present an opportunity to identify 
      prescriber's intent for the prescription and to study temporal treatment patterns. 
      In summary, NEPIs hold much promise for advancing the field of pharmacoepidemiology. 
      Researchers should take advantage of addressing important questions that can be 
      uniquely answered with NEPIs, but exercise caution when using this information and 
      carefully consider the quality of the data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many physicians enter data into the electronic medical record (EMR) as 
      unstructured free text and not as discrete data, making it challenging to use for 
      quality improvement or research initiatives. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this 
      research paper was to develop and implement a structured clinical documentation 
      support (SCDS) toolkit within the EMR to facilitate quality initiatives and 
      practice-based research in a multiple sclerosis (MS) practice. METHODS: We built 
      customized EMR toolkits to capture standardized data at office visits. Content was 
      determined through physician consensus on necessary elements to support best 
      practices in treating patients with demyelinating disorders. We also developed CDS 
      tools and best practice advisories within the toolkits to alert physicians when a 
      quality improvement opportunity exists, including enrollment into our DNA biobanking 
      study at the point of care. RESULTS: We have used the toolkit to evaluate 541 MS 
      patients in our clinic and begun collecting longitudinal data on patients who return 
      for annual visits. We provide a description and example screenshots of our toolkits, 
      and a brief description of our cohort to date. CONCLUSIONS: The EMR can be 
      effectively structured to standardize MS clinic office visits, capture data, and 
      support quality improvement and practice-based research initiatives at the point of 
      care.

AB  - An increase in antibiotic usage is considered to contribute to the emergence of 
      antimicrobial resistance. Although experts are counting on the antimicrobial 
      stewardship programs to reduce antibiotic usage, their effect remains uncertain. In 
      this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of antibiotic usage and forecast the 
      prevalence of hospital-acquired extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing 
      Escherichia coli (E. coli) using time-series analysis. Antimicrobial culture 
      information of E. coli was obtained using a text processing technique that helped 
      extract free-text electronic health records from standardized data. The 
      antimicrobial use density (AUD) of antibiotics of interest was used to estimate the 
      quarterly antibiotic usage. Transfer function model was applied to forecast 
      relationship between antibiotic usage and ESBL-producing E. coli. Of the 1938 
      hospital-acquired isolates, 831 isolates (42.9%) were ESBL-producing E. coli. Both 
      the proportion of ESBL-producing E. coli and AUD increased over time. The transfer 
      model predicted that ciprofloxacin AUD is related to the proportion of 
      ESBL-producing E. coli two quarters later. In conclusion, excessive use of 
      antibiotics was shown to affect the prevalence of resistant organisms in the future. 
      Therefore, the control of antibiotics with antimicrobial stewardship programs should 
      be considered to restrict antimicrobial resistance.

TI  - Markup of temporal information in electronic health records.
PG  - 907-8
AB  - Temporal information plays a critical role in the understanding of clinical 
      narrative (i.e., free text). We developed a representation for marking up temporal 
      information in a narrative, consisting of five elements: 1) reference point, 2) 
      direction, 3) number, 4) time unit, and 5) pattern. We identified 254 temporal 
      expressions from 50 discharge summaries and represented them using our scheme. The 
      overall inter-rater reliability among raters applying the representation model was 
      75 percent agreement. The model can contribute to temporal reasoning in computer 
      systems for decision support, data mining, and process and outcomes analyses by 
      providing structured temporal information.

TI  - Overcoming obstacles to collecting narrative data from eye care professionals at the 
      point-of-care.
PG  - 1116
AB  - Capturing the nuances of clinical observations in an electronic format has been a 
      major challenge in implementing electronic health records. In a formative evaluation 
      study using three different methodologies, we identified that the greatest obstacle 
      to point-of-care data entry for eye care was supporting free text annotation of 
      clinical observations. To overcome this obstacle, we developed an approach that 
      captures an image of a free text entry and associates this image with related data 
      elements in an encounter note. Through simulated patient studies, we observed that 
      this approach successfully supported complex documentation at the point of care by 
      clinicians.

AB  - To practice medicine in the near future, health care providers in the USA need an 
      information infrastructure they do not yet have. We offer a contribution from social 
      science research to discussions of current medical records practices and how health 
      care activity systems may be transformed by the advent of electronic health records. 
      The goal of the paper is to set forth a framework that connects over-arching 
      questions concerning medical informatics systems development with the practical, 
      cultural and conceptual issues involved in transitions from handwritten and other 
      free text documentation to structured entry of medical records to build patient 
      profiles. The research is broadly framed by an interest in how reciprocal 
      modifications of the design and use of an electronic health record are negotiated in 
      an iterative prototyping project. It is conducted as part of a complex 
      multi-disciplinary research and development effort to create an electronic health 
      record prototype for use in the integrated health care delivery environment of the 
      Southern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program.
